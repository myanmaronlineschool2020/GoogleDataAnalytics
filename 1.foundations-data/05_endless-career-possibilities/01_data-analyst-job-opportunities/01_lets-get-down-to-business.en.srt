00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,610
Hey, great to have you back.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,782
Now it's time to get down to business.

3
00:00:05,782 --> 00:00:10,150
We're going to start talking about
practical ways businesses are using data,

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,480
and the opportunities that
it can create for you.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,600
So far, you've learned a lot of
practical data analysis skills.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,270
With these next couple of videos,
we're going to switch gears a little and

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,390
talk about why you're
learning these skills.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,970
Hopefully this will give you more
perspective into what kinds of

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,690
opportunities are out there for you.

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,629
Coming up, we're going to talk more
about the kinds of roles data analysts

11
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:32,164
play in different industries.

12
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:36,151
The task that these roles required,
and the importance of fairness and

13
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:39,245
avoiding bias and
analyzing data for business tasks.

14
00:00:39,245 --> 00:00:42,440
We'll also talk about
opportunities you can tap into, and

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,620
how this program factors into your future
success and the data analyst role.

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,420
So with all that in mind,
let's get started.
