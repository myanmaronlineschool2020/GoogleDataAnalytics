Hi, I'm Joey and I work as an analytics
program manager within REWS.

2
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:14,490
Now REWS stands for real estate and
workplace services, and

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,650
my job is to bring data and
analytics into the decision-making here,

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,840
especially with regards to creating
a safe and fun work environment.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,040
My journey into analytics was a bit
different in that I had no plan or

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,113
really didn't see myself
being where I am now. Now

7
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:37,111
luckily, I started in a rotational program
called the HRA program within people

8
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:42,649
operations, which afforded me the ability
to play three different roles essentially.

9
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:48,292
I was in a generalist capacity in
a specialist role and as an analyst,

10
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:53,840
and I really found a love and
a passion in the analytical work.

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,190
I started on the business
intelligence team,

12
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,240
whose job was to provide SQL-based
reporting back to the business.

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,881
I realized the analytics is
the right career path for

14
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:09,942
me when I found myself enjoying coming
to work and getting my work done.

15
00:01:09,942 --> 00:01:13,130
And I think I can connect
that to two passions of mine.

16
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,180
The first is problem-solving.
I love taking a complex problem,

17
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,168
a mystery, a riddle and being able to find
the answers and come up with the solution.

18
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:26,714
And then the second thing is being able
to work with people and help people.

19
00:01:26,714 --> 00:01:30,850
In analytics I feel like the key
to success is being able to blend

20
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,340
the personal side with the technical side.

21
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,610
At the beginning of my career, I focused
a little more on the technical pieces, and

22
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,540
I wanted to make sure I had the right
technical knowledge to be able to answer

23
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,740
questions.

24
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,810
But what I found is over time I needed
to grow that other side just as much.

25
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,300
And I think that my career has allowed
me those opportunities to kind of

26
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,140
work each of those muscles, the human
interaction part and the technical part

27
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,050
to make sure that they're both
growing at the end of the day.
