1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,240
Previously, we learned about
what a data analyst does and

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,210
why that work is so valuable.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,270
Now, let's look at where data
analysts actually do their work.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,900
You'll learn much more about the industries
you could work in as a data analyst.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,040
And how companies in these fields are
already using data analytics to do some

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,340
really cool things.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,766
There are so many businesses out
there that have a big need for

8
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:27,063
the skills you're learning right now.

9
00:00:27,063 --> 00:00:31,767
Across industries like technology,
marketing, finance, health care, and

10
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:32,618
so many more.

11
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:37,112
Real companies are already using data
analytics to stay ahead of the curve.

12
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:41,820
And the more they use data in their
business, the more they understand just

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,490
how important data analyst
like you are to their success.

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:51,051
Let's look at a real life example of
a brand you'll probably recognize,

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,137
Coca-Cola.

16
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:56,395
Data is changing the way Coca-Cola
approaches its marketing strategies.

17
00:00:56,395 --> 00:01:01,600
Coca-Cola uses data gathered from
consumer feedback to create advertising

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,700
that speaks directly to different
audiences with different interests.

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,822
How does this work?

20
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:11,116
You know those high tech Coca-Cola
vending machines you see at movie theater

21
00:01:11,116 --> 00:01:11,852
sometimes?

22
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:14,949
It's always fun getting
to make your own flavors.

23
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:19,080
Well, those machines have built-in
artificial intelligence and

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,468
data analysis tools.

25
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:24,390
This helps Coca-Cola see all the different
kinds of flavor combinations people

26
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,540
are coming up with, which they can then
use as inspiration for new products.

27
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,690
How cool is that?

28
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,980
Ever wonder how Google gives you the right
answer to any question in just seconds?

29
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,907
That's powered by data too.

30
00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:41,959
We use all kinds of data to
determine a website's reliability and

31
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:46,940
accuracy to make sure you get the most
useful results for any search you make.

32
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,830
But it isn't just big companies like
Coca-Cola and Google that use data.

33
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,290
Small businesses everywhere are also
starting to take advantage of

34
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,930
data driven insights to improve their
operations and make better decisions.

35
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,240
Small businesses can use data
to do all kinds of things.

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,591
They might use data analytics to better
understand their customers' buying habits,

37
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:12,113
create more effective
social media messaging,

38
00:02:12,113 --> 00:02:15,154
or, in the case of one city zoo and
aquarium,

39
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:19,650
predict the number of daily visitors
based on local climate data.

40
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,810
City zoo and aquarium realized that,

41
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,850
on rainy days, they were seeing
huge drop offs in attendance,

42
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,280
but they had no way to accurately
predict when those rainy days would hit.

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,490
This made staffing a real challenge.

44
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,070
Some days they found
themselves overstaffed,

45
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,380
other days they were unprepared for
the rush of visitors.

46
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,540
To deal with this, data analyst took
years of weather records from the zoo and

47
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,550
use that data to accurately
predict future weather patterns.

48
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,620
This made it easy for the zoo to know
how much staff they needed when.

49
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,820
Because the zoo could predict and manage
their staffing needs more accurately,

50
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,950
they were able to provide a better
experience for visitors and

51
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,080
dedicate more resources to creating
a better experience for the animals too.

52
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,590
We see a similar thing in
the healthcare industry.

53
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,770
Their data analysts look at clinic
attendance data to help hospitals and

54
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:16,170
doctors offices predict when rush hours
will hit so they can be ready for it.

55
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,090
Your local city hospital
is a great example.

56
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,410
Let's say they've been getting
complaints about long wait times.

57
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,680
Sometimes an hour or more,
which made it hard for

58
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,720
some patients to get the care they needed.

59
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,250
So data analyst use data about the
hospitals daily foot traffic to help them

60
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,930
make more informed decisions about how
many doctors they need on staff at any

61
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,420
given time.

62
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,020
This helped reduce wait times,
improve their patients experience, and

63
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,443
make better use of the health
care worker's time too.

64
00:03:46,443 --> 00:03:51,302
Like I said, there are many ways that
companies in different industries put data

65
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:55,810
to use, but they can only do that if
they have data analyst they can rely on.

66
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,640
So you might be wondering,
how you fit into the equation?

67
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,700
Well, you've got plenty of options, but

68
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,750
you don't have to decide what industry
you want to work in right away. There

69
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,810
will be plenty of time to think about that
as you make your way through this program.

70
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,370
By the time you finish this program, you
have the core skills that will make you

71
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,750
valuable in any industry that
makes data driven decisions.

72
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,548
Which, as it turns out,
is most industries, even zoos.

73
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:26,444
Coming up, we'll check out the business
task where data can be helpful.

74
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:31,164
And, we'll explore even more how data
analysts are empowering businesses

75
00:04:31,164 --> 00:04:32,130
through data.

76
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,990
I'll see you then.
