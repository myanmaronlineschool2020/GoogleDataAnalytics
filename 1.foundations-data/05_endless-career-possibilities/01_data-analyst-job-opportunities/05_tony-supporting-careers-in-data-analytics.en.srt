1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,810
For any analyst, for any person

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,370
that's honestly at the early
stages of their career,

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,030
understanding data,
respecting data and knowing

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,240
how to work with data is
incredibly important because,

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,120
my vision is that every role in

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,675
some form or fashion will
involve data and its use

7
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:24,630
in learning how to extract
insights from it will be at

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,280
the core of any critical role

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,975
across any company organization.

10
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:29,700
Generally in those
first two years,

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,520
you are developing the core skill

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,905
sets that make you a
fantastic generalist,

13
00:00:33,905 --> 00:00:36,770
and then in the next 2-5 years,

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,690
you're learning about something

15
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,315
very specific as as it
relates to your job.

16
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:43,550
Whether it's the area
that you're supporting

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,950
or maybe a very
technical component.

18
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,240
Like, let's say you want to

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,950
become a SQL expert
so that you can

20
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,180
manipulate large data sets

21
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,015
for financial analysis purposes.

22
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:54,050
Similarly, even if you come into

23
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,285
finance as a data analyst,

24
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:59,260
you can pop out of
finance and go into what

25
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,055
a lot of people like
to call the business,

26
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:03,710
which is typically your
Operations Functions and

27
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,755
become a business analyst
or a data analysts.

28
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:09,230
There's so many different
paths that you can take from

29
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,625
the starting point that

30
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,705
you really can't
predict your end.

31
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:16,660
I'm just deeply passionate
about working with and

32
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,670
supporting young
people and really

33
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,445
giving them a jumpstart
to their career.

34
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:25,805
This stems from honestly my
own personal experience,

35
00:01:25,805 --> 00:01:28,225
where in the first two
years of my career,

36
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:30,640
I had essentially zero support

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,440
from my manager and my
direct management chain.

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,085
Having gone through that
experience my first few years,

39
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:37,900
I realize and I felt

40
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,180
experience how that
can slow you down,

41
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,550
and especially when you are
somebody that has a lot

42
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,905
of potential and
a lot of ability,

43
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,080
you want to be in
an environment that

44
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,275
fosters that ability and
really wants to see you grow.

45
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:52,660
I think it's incredibly
important to

46
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,275
have programs like these that

47
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:57,170
take away all the barriers

48
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,500
that remove any of the
constructs that prevent

49
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,170
people from being able
to find out what they

50
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,190
need to be in an
industry like this,

51
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,280
to be successful in a
role like a data analyst,

52
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,990
so that they themselves can

53
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,165
dream about where they
can go in their career.

54
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:18,870
