  As you know, this program asks you to complete graded assessments at the end of each module and course. Assessments can sometimes feel overwhelming, but approaching them with a strategy can make them more manageable. Here is a list of tips you can use to prime yourself for success.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Before taking an assessment:
 </h2>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review your notes, the videos, the readings, and the most recent glossary to refresh yourself on the content.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Find a picture of something or an object that makes you feel happy. For example, you might look at a photograph of a beautiful beach or a peaceful forest when you feel overwhelmed.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
  During the assessment:
 </h2>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the test before filling in answers. Remember to check your work before you click
    <em>
     submit
    </em>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take your time. You are given a full five minutes per question on all graded assessments.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Answer the easy questions first; skip the ones you don’t know the answer to right away.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    For multiple choice questions, focus on eliminating the wrong answers first.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Read each question twice. There are often clues that are easy to miss the first time.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Remember to slow down and trust your knowledge. You probably know more than you give yourself credit for.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take a deep breath and give yourself positive feedback.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take some time during the assessment to rest for a few seconds, stretch, and shake out your hands. This can really help calm your nerves.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
  If you start to feel anxious:
 </h2>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Spell your name backwards or do an easy math problem. This brings you back to the frontal lobe of your brain, which helps you recall information more easily.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Focus on calm, steady breathing.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Visualize success.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
  Before you submit the assessment:
 </h2>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Check your work, but be confident. Sometimes people change correct answers because they
    <em>
     feel
    </em>
    wrong, but they’re actually right. Your first instinct is usually correct.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
