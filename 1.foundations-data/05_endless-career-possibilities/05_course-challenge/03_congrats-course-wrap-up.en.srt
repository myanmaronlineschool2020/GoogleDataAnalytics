1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,140
Congratulations on finishing
this first course.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,195
You've already learned a lot

3
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:07,950
and you're ready to
take what you've

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,915
learned and move forward

5
00:00:09,915 --> 00:00:11,955
and if you ever need a refresher,

6
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:14,160
just remember that
these videos will still

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,560
be here whenever you need them.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,720
You might remember your
next instructor from

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,465
our introduction at the
beginning of the intro course.

10
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:23,820
Get ready to meet
my fellow Googler

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,630
and your instructor for the
next course, Ximena.

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,860
She's ready to help you get

13
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,750
started on your next step towards

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,200
finishing this program and
becoming a data analyst.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,000
This next course will build

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,540
directly on some of the
topics you've learned

17
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,490
so far and give you insight

18
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,160
into the things we've
already talked about.

19
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,885
Like any good detective,

20
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:47,090
you learn how to ask
the right questions

21
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,850
and use data to find answers.

22
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,235
Employees in every industry

23
00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:54,850
needs to become comfortable
asking questions,

24
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,920
but this can especially be
true for data analysts.

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,890
A lot of data analysts try
to make their work perfect

26
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,020
the first time even though

27
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,660
they might not have
all the information.

28
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,579
Instead of asking questions,

29
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:11,000
they make assumptions that
can lead to mistakes.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,865
It's so much better to be humble

31
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,725
and inquisitive and
to ask questions.

32
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:19,845
I'll show you what I mean.

33
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:21,930
One of the analysts I supervise

34
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,395
came into Google with
no coding experience.

35
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:27,320
He was nervous about leaving
a great first impression,

36
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,940
so he tried to study up on

37
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,225
multiple languages by
himself before he started.

38
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,280
When the work actually began,

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,540
he didn't ask us

40
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,180
his team questions or

41
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,790
ask us for help when he
ran into roadblocks.

42
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,000
There are a lot of great
places to find answers,

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,515
especially online,

44
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:49,265
and his initiative helped them
find some of those places.

45
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:50,945
But at the end of the day,

46
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:54,335
he forgot to tap into
his best resource, us,

47
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:57,110
his team, because he was nervous

48
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,440
about how he would be perceived
if he asked us for help.

49
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,820
He almost missed out on

50
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,580
some great insights
from his team members.

51
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,740
As roadblocks persisted, he

52
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,975
realized he needed
to make a change.

53
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:12,230
He stopped trying to guess
expectations, processes,

54
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,180
and more all on his own and

55
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,700
started asking us more questions.

56
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,280
As soon as he embraced
this new approach,

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,440
he skyrocketed on our team.

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,880
His learning went straight up

59
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,475
the curve like a hockey stick.

60
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:26,780
His impact on the organization,

61
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,420
the number of people who
reached out to him and his

62
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,435
career path going for
it all did the same.

63
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:34,025
The bottom line is,

64
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:36,140
you don't need to know it all.

65
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,955
The saying is true,

66
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:40,370
there are no bad questions.

67
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,170
Being open to learning is one of

68
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,770
the most important qualities
for a data analyst.

69
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,560
Speaking of learning,
in the next course,

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
we'll go into more
depth learning about

71
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,050
basic spreadsheet skills and
when you need to use them,

72
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,670
you'll discover how to apply

73
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,440
structured thinking to data work,

74
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,840
and your focus on
how to best meet

75
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,225
stakeholder needs
and expectations

76
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,025
by gathering all the clues.

77
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:08,220
Great work, and good
luck on the next course.
