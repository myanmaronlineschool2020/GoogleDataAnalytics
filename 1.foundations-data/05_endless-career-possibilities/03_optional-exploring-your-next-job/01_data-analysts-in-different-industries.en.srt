1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,720
By now, we know that
there are all kinds of

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,085
jobs in different industries
available for data analysts.

3
00:00:07,085 --> 00:00:08,970
But now it's time to think

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,875
about something
just as important,

5
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,650
how can you tell if a
job is a good fit for

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,965
you and your career
goals? Tough one.

7
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:19,140
Don't worry, that's exactly what

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,505
we'll cover in this video.

9
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:22,560
There's a lot of
important factors to

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,885
think about when searching
for your dream job.

11
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:28,005
Let's talk about some of the
most common factors first,

12
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:33,210
industry, tools, location,
travel, and culture.

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,130
Data is already being used by

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,250
countless industries in all
kinds of different ways,

15
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,615
tech, marketing,
finance, health care,

16
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:43,625
the list goes on.

17
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,250
But one thing that's
important to keep in mind,

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,115
every industry has
specific data needs

19
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,300
that have to be addressed

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,525
differently by their
data analysts.

21
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:54,650
The same revenue
data can be used in

22
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,030
three different ways by

23
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,595
data analysts in three
different industries,

24
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:01,925
financial services,
Telecom, and tech.

25
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:04,370
For example, a finance analyst at

26
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,710
a bank post public
revenue data of

27
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,920
Telecom company X to
create a forecast that

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,810
predicts where
revenues will be in

29
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,940
the future to recommend
the stock price.

30
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,965
The business analyst
at Telecom company X

31
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:20,750
uses that same data to
advise the sales team.

32
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,225
Then a data analyst
at the company

33
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:25,760
who created a customer
management tool for

34
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,310
Telecom company X will use that

35
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,140
revenue data to determine how

36
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,905
efficiently the
software is performing.

37
00:01:32,905 --> 00:01:35,875
Finance, telecom, and tech,

38
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,904
all use data differently,

39
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:41,045
so they need analysts who
have different skills.

40
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:44,060
It all comes down to what the
needs of the industry are.

41
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,470
Those needs will determine
what task you'll be given,

42
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,510
the questions you'll
be answering and

43
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,670
even how you'll
approach job searching.

44
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,140
If you're just starting out,

45
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,210
a great way to guide
your search is to

46
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,005
think first about what
you're interested in.

47
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:00,800
Does helping people get

48
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,585
healthier sound
meaningful to you?

49
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:04,160
Maybe you want to focus on using

50
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,380
data to improve
hospital admissions.

51
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,835
What about helping people
save for a happy retirement?

52
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:12,560
You might want a job
that uses data to

53
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,245
determine risk factors in
financial investments.

54
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:17,030
Or maybe you're
interested in helping

55
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,985
journalism grow in your city.

56
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:21,410
A job using data to help find

57
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,360
your local news website find

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,840
more subscribers could be
the perfect role for you.

59
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,790
The key is to think about

60
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,585
your interests early
in your job search.

61
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,044
That'll lead you in
the right direction,

62
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:36,515
and it will help you
in interviews too.

63
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:38,630
Potential employers
will want to know

64
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,820
why you're interested
in their company,

65
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,910
and how you can
address their needs,

66
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,270
so if you can speak about

67
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,890
your motivation to work in

68
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,675
data analytics during interviews,

69
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:50,270
you'll make yourself
stand out in a great way.

70
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,730
You'll have options
when it comes to

71
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,880
where you work and
who you work for.

72
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,300
But remember, you want
to enjoy what you do,

73
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,040
so it's a good idea to think

74
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,335
about how you want
to use your skills.

75
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:06,440
Then search for jobs that
allow you to do that.

76
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,240
Next on the list
of things to think

77
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,560
about, location and travel.

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,320
When you start your job search,

79
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,640
you need to make some decisions

80
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,125
about where you want to live,

81
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,870
so it helps to ask
yourself some questions,

82
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,535
does your preferred industry have

83
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:21,610
opportunities in your area?

84
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,480
Are you trying to stay local

85
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,520
or would you be happy relocating?

86
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,970
How long are you willing to
commute to work every day?

87
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,605
Will you drive to work,

88
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:33,275
walk, take public transport?

89
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:35,420
Is that possible year-round?

90
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,915
How do you feel about
working remotely?

91
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:41,160
Does working from home
excite you or bore you?

92
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,390
Of course, you'll want to
consider cost of living,

93
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,220
and whether or not you want

94
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,400
the convenience of city living
or a quiet suburban home,

95
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,515
and it's not just about
where you'll be based,

96
00:03:51,515 --> 00:03:53,525
some jobs may ask you to travel,

97
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,340
which could be an
exciting chance to see

98
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,625
the world or a deal-breaker.

99
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,215
It's all about what you
want out of this job,

100
00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:02,915
so start asking yourself
some of these questions.

101
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:04,820
Figuring out the
answers can help you

102
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,960
narrow down your
search even further,

103
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,705
so you're only looking at
jobs you'd actually accept.

104
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:13,204
Once you've answered
enough questions,

105
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:14,420
you'll be able to identify

106
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,360
some specific companies
that fit your needs.

107
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,060
At this point, it's a
good time to think about

108
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,380
your values and what

109
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,605
company culture is
a good fit for you.

110
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:27,739
Ready, here comes
some more questions,

111
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:31,265
do you work best in a
team or by yourself?

112
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:34,310
Do you like to have a
set routine or do you

113
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,825
enjoy taking a new project
and trying new things?

114
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:40,695
Do your values match
the company's values?

115
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:43,130
You'll want to pay attention
to these things during

116
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,490
your job search and
interview process,

117
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,300
so you can be sure you fully

118
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,720
invested in the
company you work for.

119
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,710
That's the best way
to start building

120
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,945
an exciting and
fulfilling career.

121
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:56,150
This program will help you learn

122
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,335
the core skills for data
analytics in any setting,

123
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:02,180
it's up to you where
you want to take them,

124
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,599
whether that means starting
in a completely new industry,

125
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:07,790
or moving into an
analyst position in

126
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,730
an industry you already
have experience in.

127
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,460
Hopefully what we've
covered here has helped

128
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,495
you get on track for
your future job search.

129
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:19,730
After this, you have a
few activities to do,

130
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,110
and then you'll be
able to move on to

131
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,780
the next part of this course.

132
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,785
We learned a lot so far,

133
00:05:24,785 --> 00:05:27,080
like what opportunities
are out there

134
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,465
for data analysts in
different industries.

135
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:33,170
How data analysts help businesses
make better decisions.

136
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,965
The importance of fairness
and data analytics,

137
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:38,390
and the potential
questions you can start

138
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,230
asking yourself before
your future job search,

139
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,070
and you can always look back at

140
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,445
these lessons if
you want to review.

141
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,045
In an upcoming course,

142
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,730
we'll look at the skills all
successful data analysts

143
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,290
have and you'll learn how

144
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,180
you can start
practicing them too.

145
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,060
But before that, you'll
have an assessment.

146
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,220
Good luck, and I'll
see you later.
