00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,530
My name is Samah Moid,
and I'm a recruiter

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,230
here at Google for the
large customer sales team.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,795
Basically, I hire talent
for the sales team here.

4
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:14,580
Even within the sales
recruiting space,

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,990
I recruit specifically for

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,960
the analytical lead
roles here at Google.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,615
I want the candidate to be
as comfortable as possible.

8
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:24,090
As a recruiter I'm
also their advocate.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,740
If they're a good
fit for the team,

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,390
I'd like to present
them in the best light.

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,525
As a recruiter some
advice I would give for

12
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:33,820
a data analyst that's
starting to look for a job.

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,070
Think about a time where you've

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,765
used data to solve a problem,

15
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:39,610
whether it's in your professional
or personal projects.

16
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,030
Another tip, I would say

17
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,010
for a data analyst that's looking

18
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,745
for a new job is to increase
your professional network.

19
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:48,200
There are many ways to increase

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,230
your professional network.

21
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,250
One of them is to increase
your online footprint,

22
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,845
reach out to other
analysts on LinkedIn,

23
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:58,250
join local meet-ups with
other data scientists.

24
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,670
Sometimes when we're looking
for a unique skill set,

25
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,380
recruiters are going on
websites like LinkedIn,

26
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,650
and GitHub, and trying to
find that talent themselves.

27
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,210
It's really important
to have your LinkedIn

28
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,820
updated along with
websites like GitHub,

29
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,260
where you can showcase a lot of

30
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,245
the data analysts
projects you've done.

31
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:16,100
Another tip I would say for

32
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,270
an in-person interview is to

33
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,385
prepare questions
for the interviewer.

34
00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:22,030
Make sure they're
not broad questions.

35
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,500
They should be questions that
will help you understand

36
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,170
the team and the job better.

37
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,270
If you're given a case
study in an interview,

38
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,530
you should expect to be given

39
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,930
a business problem along
with the sample data set.

40
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,420
Then you'd be asked to
take that sample data set,

41
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,045
analyze it, and come
up with a solution.

42
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:40,520
One of the things you can do
to help prepare yourself for

43
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,950
this is to ensure

44
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,260
you are analyzing the data

45
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,400
and coming up with a solution

46
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,855
that relates back to that data.

47
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:49,715
Sometimes there is
no right answer,

48
00:01:49,715 --> 00:01:51,890
and a lot of times interviewers
are looking to see

49
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,060
your thought process and the way

50
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,740
you get to your solution.

51
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,360
I highly encourage that if you

52
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,860
find a role that
you're interested in,

53
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,020
not only apply to it,
but go the next step.

54
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,340
Look for the recruiter. Look for

55
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,450
the hiring manager online.

56
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,460
See if you can reach
out to them and set up

57
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,285
a coffee chat or send them
your resume directly.

58
00:02:07,285 --> 00:02:08,930
Online applications could be

59
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,870
a really big black hole where

60
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,185
you never hear back from
the recruiter or the team.

61
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:16,460
When you reach out directly to

62
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,750
a hiring manager or recruiter,

63
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,985
it really shows your eagerness

64
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:22,770
for the role and your
interests for the role.

65
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,440
Even if sometimes you don't

66
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,255
get a response from reaching out,

67
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:29,630
you never know, you try
multiple different times.

68
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,130
That one time you get a response

69
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,960
back from a recruiter
or hiring manager,

70
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,090
could be the time you get the
job that you really wanted.
