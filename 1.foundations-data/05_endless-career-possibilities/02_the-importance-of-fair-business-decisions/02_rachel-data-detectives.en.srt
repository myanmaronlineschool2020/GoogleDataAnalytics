Hi, my name is Rachel,

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,310
and I'm the Business systems and

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,825
analytics lead at Verily.

4
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:10,610
There are a lot of
different types of

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,620
problems that a data
analyst can solve.

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,840
I've been lucky
enough over my career

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,360
to have seen a lot of them and

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,150
to take in a lot of
very different types of

9
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,225
data and help turn that
into meaningful answers.

10
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:24,260
I think one of the most

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,490
important things
to remember about

12
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,100
data analytics is
that data is data.

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,010
I'm a finance data analyst and so

14
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,570
my role at Verily is to take

15
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,250
all of our financial information,

16
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,870
all of the information of

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,405
the money we're spending
and the money we're making,

18
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,090
and turn that into
reports and insights

19
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,350
so that our business leads

20
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,880
can understand what we're doing.

21
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,665
One of the most important
things I've done

22
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:47,420
at Verily recently was help

23
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,130
create what's called
a profit and loss

24
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,230
statement for each of
our business units.

25
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,795
That means that in real time,

26
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:55,880
our teams can see
what their budget

27
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,795
is and how they're spending
against that budget.

28
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:01,940
What that does is that
helps our teams keep to

29
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,940
that budget by either increasing

30
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,530
their revenue streams
so that they have

31
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,840
more money to play
with or pulling

32
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,490
back their spending so that they

33
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,220
can keep themselves
within that budget.

34
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,410
All of that really
helps keep us on

35
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,880
track as a company in

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,515
making sure that we're
hitting our goals.

37
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:22,220
I found that data acts like a
living and breathing thing.

38
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,695
When you have a ton
of data points,

39
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:26,390
it can be overwhelming

40
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,510
when you first sit down
to make sense of it.

41
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,320
You have tons of columns,

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,560
tons of records, tons of
different types of data,

43
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,380
and finding a way to make
sense of that is really

44
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,880
hard and that's where

45
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,990
the expertise of a
data analyst comes in.

46
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,390
It has been some of the most

47
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,190
frustrating moments of my career,

48
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,350
but also some of the
most rewarding work I've

49
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,510
ever done when it
finally comes together.

50
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,980
The best advice I have for

51
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,215
any data analyst starting
out is keep at it.

52
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:52,670
If the angle you're
taking doesn't

53
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,140
work, try to find another one.

54
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,520
Try to come at it
in a different way,

55
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,750
try to ask a different question,

56
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,460
and eventually the data will

57
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,970
yield and you'll get the
insights you're looking for.
