1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,460
As a data analyst,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,620
you'll be tackling
business tasks that help

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,410
companies use data. Coming up,

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,130
we'll talk more about what a
business task actually is,

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,870
and some examples of
what they might look

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,060
like in real data analyst jobs.

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,590
Let's take a second and think

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,300
back on the real examples of

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,190
businesses using data analytics

10
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,410
and their operation
we've seen before.

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,615
You might have noticed
a common theme

12
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:26,115
across every example.

13
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:28,470
They all have issues to explore,

14
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,680
questions to answer,
or problems to solve.

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,415
It's easy for these
things to get mixed up.

16
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:36,770
Here's a way to keep
them straight when we

17
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,080
talk about them in
data analytics.

18
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,685
An issue is a topic or
subject to investigate.

19
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:46,880
A question is designed to
discover information and

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,860
a problem is an obstacle or

21
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,415
complication that needs
to be worked out.

22
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:54,375
Coca-Cola had a question
about new products.

23
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,615
Data analysis gave them insights

24
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:59,320
into new flavors
customers already like.

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,870
The City Zoo and Aquarium
had a problem with staffing.

26
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,950
Data, helped them figure out
the best staffing strategy.

27
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,200
These questions and
problems become

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,100
the foundation for all
kinds of business tasks,

29
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,945
that you'll help solve
as a data analyst.

30
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:17,540
A business task is
the question or

31
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,100
problem data analysis
answers for business.

32
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,940
This is where you focus a lot of

33
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,925
your efforts in the work you'll
do for future employers.

34
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:28,550
Let's stick with our zoo
example and see if we can

35
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,015
imagine what a business task
for a zoo might look like.

36
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:33,650
We know the problem,

37
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,540
unpredictable weather
was making it

38
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,630
hard for the zoo to
anticipate staffing needs.

39
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,020
Maybe the business task
could be something like,

40
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,760
analyze weather data from

41
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,050
the last decade to identify
predictable patterns.

42
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,710
The data analysts could then

43
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,855
plan out the best way to gather,

44
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:53,210
analyze, and present
the data needed

45
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,865
to solve this task and
meet the zoos goals.

46
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,430
Then, using data, the zoo
would be able to make

47
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,315
informed decisions about
their daily staffing.

48
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:03,440
We talked a little
about data-driven

49
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,735
decision making in
previous videos.

50
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:09,220
But just in case you need
a refresher, here it is.

51
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,890
Data-driven decision-making
is when facts that have been

52
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,870
discovered through data analysis

53
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,210
are used to guide
business strategy.

54
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,520
The simplest way to think
about decision-making

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,340
is that it's a choice
between consequences,

56
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,475
good, bad, or a
combination of both.

57
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:27,125
In our zoo example,

58
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,600
the zoo had the data
they needed to make

59
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,450
an informed decision that
solved their problem.

60
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,150
But what if they had made
this decision without data?

61
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,345
Let's say they just
relied on observation

62
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:39,470
and memory to track

63
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,840
the weather and make
staffing schedules.

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,970
Well, we already know that

65
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,130
wouldn't have solve
their problem long-term.

66
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,280
Data analytics gave them
the information they needed

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,720
to find the best possible
solution to their problem.

68
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,540
That's the power of data.

69
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,930
Observation and intuition are

70
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,880
powerful tools in
decision-making,

71
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,790
but they can only take
us so far when we make

72
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,330
decisions based on just
observation and gut feelings,

73
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,805
we're only seeing
part of the picture.

74
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:10,450
Data helps us see
the whole thing.

75
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,960
With data, we have

76
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,065
a complete picture of the
problem and its causes,

77
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:16,400
which lets us find

78
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,260
new and surprising solutions

79
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,530
we never would've been
able to see before.

80
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,230
Data analytics helps businesses
make better decisions.

81
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,820
It all starts with

82
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,150
a business task and the
question it's trying to answer.

83
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,015
With the skills you'll learn
throughout this program,

84
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:34,339
you'll be able to ask
the right questions,

85
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,805
plan out the best way to
gather and analyze data,

86
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:40,940
and then present it visually
to arm your team so

87
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,215
they can make an informed,
data-driven decision.

88
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:46,250
That makes you critical to

89
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,295
the success of any
business you work for.

90
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,440
Data is a powerful tool.

91
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,720
With great power comes, well,

92
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,790
you know the rest.
And you're doing

93
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,210
a super job taking in
all of this information.

94
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,970
Up next, we'll talk about
your responsibility

95
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,700
as a data analyst to make
sure you're gathering,

96
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,430
analyzing, and presenting
data in a way that's

97
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,430
fair to the people being
represented by that data.
