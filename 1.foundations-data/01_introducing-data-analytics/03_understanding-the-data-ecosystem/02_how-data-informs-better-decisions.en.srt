1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:05,910
So far, you've discovered that there
are many different ways data can be

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,860
used. In our everyday lives,

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,590
we use data when we wear
a fitness tracker or

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,280
read product reviews to
make a purchase decision.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,210
And in business, we use data to
learn more about our customers,

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,570
improve processes, and help employees
do their jobs more effectively.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,460
But this is just the tip of the iceberg.

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,990
One of the most powerful ways you can put
data to work is with data-driven decision-making.

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,090
Data-driven decision-making is defined as
using facts to guide business strategy.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,746
Organizations in many different
industries are empowered to make better,

11
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:43,030
data-driven decisions by
data analysts all the time.

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:49,140
The first step in data-driven decision-making
is figuring out the business need.

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,570
Usually, this is a problem
that needs to be solved.

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,260
For example, a problem could be a new
company needing to establish better

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,260
brand recognition, so it can compete with
bigger, more well-known competitors.

16
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,350
Or maybe an organization wants to improve
a product and needs to figure out how to

17
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,770
source parts from a more sustainable
or ethically responsible supplier.

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,710
Or, it could be a business trying to
solve the problem of unhappy employees,

19
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,780
low levels of engagement,
satisfaction and retention.

20
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,180
Whatever the problem is, once it's
defined, a data analyst finds data,

21
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,590
analyzes it and uses it to uncover trends,
patterns and relationships.

22
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,150
Sometimes the data-driven strategy will
build on what's worked in the past.

23
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,230
Other times, it can guide a business
to branch out in a whole new direction.

24
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,210
Let's look at a real-world example.

25
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,330
Think about a music or
movie streaming service.

26
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,900
How do these companies know what
people want to watch or listen to,

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,415
and how do they provide it?

28
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:53,880
Well using data-driven decision-making,

29
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,160
they gather information about what their
customers are currently listening to,

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,990
analyze it, then use the insights
they've gained to make suggestions for

31
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,300
things people will most
likely enjoy in the future.

32
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,419
This keeps customers happy and

33
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:13,200
coming back for more, which in turn
means more revenue for the company.

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,225
Another example of data-driven
decision-making can be seen in the rise of

35
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:18,400
e-commerce.

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,240
It wasn't long ago that most purchases
were made in a physical store,

37
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,430
but the data showed people's
preferences were changing.

38
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,940
So a lot of companies created entirely
new business models that remove

39
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,080
the physical store, and let people
shop right from their computers or

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,890
mobile phones with products
delivered right to their doorstep.

41
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,920
In fact, data-driven decision-making
can be so powerful,

42
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,860
it can make entire
business methods obsolete.

43
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,956
For example, data helped companies
completely move away from

44
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:53,362
corded phones and
replace them with mobile phones.

45
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:57,196
By ensuring that data is built
into every business strategy,

46
00:02:57,196 --> 00:03:01,250
data analysts play a critical role
in their companies' success, but

47
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,500
it's important to note that no matter how
valuable data-driven decision-making is,

48
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,350
data alone will never be as powerful
as data combined with human experience,

49
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,300
observation, and sometimes even intuition.

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,150
To get the most out of data-driven
decision-making, it's important to include

51
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,840
insights from people who are familiar
with the business problem.

52
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,520
These people are called subject matter
experts, and they have the ability to look

53
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,640
at the results of data analysis and
identify any inconsistencies,

54
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,300
make sense of gray areas, and
eventually validate choices being made.

55
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,380
Organizations that work this way put data
at the heart of every business strategy,

56
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,838
but also benefit from
the insights of their people.

57
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:48,270
It's a win-win.

58
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,670
As a data analyst, you play a key role in
empowering these organizations to make

59
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,090
data-driven decisions,
which is why it's so important for

60
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,280
you to understand how data plays
a part in the decision-making process.
