00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,890
Hello again. You've already learned
about being a data analyst

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,110
and how this program will help
prepare you for your future career.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,000
Now, it's time to explore
the data ecosystem,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,290
find out where data analytics fits into
that system, and go over some common

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,180
misconceptions you might run into
in the field of data analytics.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,800
To put it simply, an ecosystem is a group
of elements that interact with one

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,440
another. Ecosystems can be large,
like the jungle in a tropical rainforest

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,710
or the Australian outback.

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,780
Or, tiny, like tadpoles in a puddle,
or bacteria on your skin.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,520
And just like the kangaroos and
koala bears in the Australian outback,

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,286
data lives inside its own ecosystem too.

12
00:00:46,286 --> 00:00:51,878
Data ecosystems are made up of various
elements that interact with one another

13
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:57,480
in order to produce, manage, store,
organize, analyze, and share data.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,840
These elements include hardware and
software tools, and

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,350
the people who use them.

16
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,700
People like you.

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,720
Data can also be found in
something called the cloud.

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,780
The cloud is a place to keep data online,
rather than on a computer hard drive.

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,852
So instead of storing data somewhere
inside your organization's network,

20
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:18,052
that data is accessed over the internet.

21
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:22,220
So the cloud is just a term we use
to describe the virtual location.

22
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,590
The cloud plays a big part in the data
ecosystem, and as a data analyst, it's

23
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,400
your job to harness the power of that data
ecosystem, find the right information,

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,300
and provide the team with analysis
that helps them make smart decisions.

25
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,860
For example, you could tap into
your retail store's database,

26
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,070
which is an ecosystem filled
with customer names, addresses,

27
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,770
previous purchases, and customer reviews.

28
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,620
As a data analyst, you could use this
information to predict what these

29
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,540
customers will buy in the future,

30
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,950
and make sure the store has the products
and stock when they're needed.

31
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,490
As another example,

32
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,070
let's think about a data ecosystem
used by a human resources department.

33
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,540
This ecosystem would include information
like postings from job websites,

34
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,180
stats on the current labor market,

35
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,720
employment rates, and social media
data on prospective employees.

36
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,140
A data analyst could use this information
to help their team recruit new workers

37
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,800
and improve employee engagement and
retention rates.

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,620
But data ecosystems aren't just for stores
and offices. They work on farms, too.

39
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,310
Agricultural companies regularly
use data ecosystems that

40
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,890
include information including geological
patterns in weather movements.

41
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:41,280
Data analysts can use this data to
help farmers predict crop yields.

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,550
Some data analysts are even using
data ecosystems to save real

43
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,090
environmental ecosystems.

44
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,760
At the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography, coral reefs all over

45
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,530
the world are monitored digitally, so they
can see how organisms change over time,

46
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,570
track their growth, and
measure any increases or

47
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,820
declines in individual colonies.

48
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,195
The possibilities are endless.

49
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:11,235
Okay, now let's talk about some common
misconceptions you might come across.

50
00:03:11,235 --> 00:03:15,960
First is the difference between
data scientists and data analysts.

51
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,700
It's easy to confuse the two, but
what they do is actually very different.

52
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,280
Data science is defined as
creating new ways of modeling and

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,670
understanding the unknown
by using raw data.

54
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,050
Here's a good way to think about it.

55
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,940
Data scientists create new questions
using data, while analysts find

56
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,530
answers to existing questions by
creating insights from data sources.

57
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,090
There are also many words and

58
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,060
phrases you'll hear throughout this course,
that are easy to get mixed up.

59
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,890
For example, data analysis and
data analytics sound the same,

60
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,056
but they're actually very different
things. Let's start with analysis.

61
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:57,889
You've already learned that data analysis
is the collection, transformation,

62
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:01,134
and organization of data in
order to draw conclusions,

63
00:04:01,134 --> 00:04:04,536
make predictions, and
drive informed decision-making.

64
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:09,140
Data analytics in the simplest
terms is the science of data.

65
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,580
It's a very broad concept that encompasses
everything from the job of managing and

66
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,510
using data to the tools and methods that
data workers use each and every day.

67
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,070
So when you think about data,
data analysis and

68
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,540
the data ecosystem, it's important
to understand that all of these

69
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,150
things fit under the data
analytics umbrella.

70
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,300
All right, now that you know a little
more about the data ecosystem and

71
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,760
the differences between data analysis and
data analytics,

72
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,310
you're ready to explore how data is
used to make effective decisions.

73
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,480
You'll get to see data-driven
decision-making, in action.
