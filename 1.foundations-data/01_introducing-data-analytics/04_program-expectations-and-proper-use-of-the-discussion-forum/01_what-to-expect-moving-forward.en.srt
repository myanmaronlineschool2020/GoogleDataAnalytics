1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,840
We've covered a lot.
I'm sure you have so

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,080
much to think about already.
That's a good thing.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,450
It means you've started
collecting data and

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,775
you're doing your own
personal analysis.

5
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:13,275
That's what it's all about.

6
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:15,570
You've built a
great base already.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,159
As this course continues,

8
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:19,875
your knowledge and
data analysis skills

9
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,460
will continue to grow.

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,065
Once you've established
a solid foundation,

11
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,670
you'll apply what you've learned

12
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,350
to the rest of the program.

13
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,570
The data analysis
process will help

14
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,165
provide a framework
for everything you do.

15
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:35,780
Soon, you'll take your
first graded assessment.

16
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,150
It's a great way to check
your understanding of

17
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,810
the concepts and build
confidence in your knowledge.

18
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,790
Everyone learns at
different speeds.

19
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,885
So take your time.

20
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:46,580
Get familiar with the concepts.

21
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,380
As soon as you feel ready,

22
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,480
you can go ahead and get started.

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,110
Keep in mind, if at any point,

24
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,325
you're not sure about a question,

25
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:57,440
you can always review
the videos and

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,035
readings to remind
yourself of the answer.

27
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:02,600
We're all about open-
book tests here.

28
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,170
Once you've passed, you'll
be all set to move on.

29
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,780
You've got this.
Before you know it,

30
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,450
you'll be done with all
of the courses, and you'll

31
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,270
be ready to create
your own case study.

32
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,535
Then, if it's what
you want to do,

33
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,170
you'll start your job search,

34
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,270
equipped with the
tools and skills

35
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,835
that will wow any
company you talk to.

36
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:26,710
I can't wait to see where
you go with data analytics.

37
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,435
For now though, give
yourself a pat on the back

38
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:33,480
for a job well
done. See you soon.
