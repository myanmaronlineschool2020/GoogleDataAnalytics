  During this program, you will be asked to complete a few short surveys. These are part of a research study to understand how effective the certificate has been for you. Please see below for a summary of what each survey will cover. Your survey participation is optional, but extremely helpful in making this course as effective as possible. There are no correct answers, and your responses and personal data will:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Not affect your course experience, scores, or ability to receive a certificate or job in any way.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Be kept confidential, with your name separated from your data.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Not be shared outside of our research team, except where you give permission to share contact information with hiring partners.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Thanks for your consideration and time!

  Entry survey
 </h2>
 <p>
  Up next, you will have the opportunity to fill out a brief survey to help us understand why you have enrolled in this certificate program. If you donâ€™t fill it out now, you will receive an invitation to fill out the survey after completing one lecture or assignment.
 </p>
 <p>
  The survey will ask about your experiences leading up to this course and the goals you hope to accomplish. This is critical information for making sure we can meet the needs of learners like you, and can continue offering this program in the future.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Individual course feedback
 </h2>
 <p>
  When you complete the last graded assignment within an individual course, you may be asked to complete a survey that revisits earlier questions and asks what you have learned up to that point in the program. Again, filling out this information is voluntary, but extremely beneficial to the program and future learners.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Certificate completion survey
 </h2>
 <p>
  After you complete the last graded assignment in the final course of the certificate, you will be asked to answer a survey that revisits some earlier questions and asks what you have learned throughout the duration of the program. This survey also asks if you would like to share your contact information with prospective employers. Both filling out the survey and sharing your contact information with prospective employers is completely optional. Again, participating in the survey or sharing your information with future employers will not affect your course experience, scores, or ability to receive a certificate or job in any way.
