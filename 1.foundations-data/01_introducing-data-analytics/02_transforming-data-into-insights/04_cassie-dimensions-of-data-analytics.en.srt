00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,420
Hi. I'm Cassie, and I lead

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,365
Decision Intelligence
for Google Cloud.

3
00:00:08,365 --> 00:00:10,990
Decision Intelligence
is a combination of

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,310
applied data science and

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,435
the social and
managerial sciences.

6
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:18,760
It is all about harnessing
the power and beauty of data.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,510
I help Google Cloud
and its customers turn

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,090
their data into impact and

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,955
make their businesses
and the world better.

10
00:00:27,955 --> 00:00:29,890
A data analyst is an explorer,

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,920
a detective, and an artist
all rolled into one.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,575
Analytics is the quest
for inspiration.

13
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:39,490
You don't know what's going to

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,440
inspire you before you explore,

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,525
before you take a look around.

16
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:47,720
When you begin, you
have no idea what

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,325
you're going to find and

18
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:51,725
whether you're even
going to find anything.

19
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:54,695
You have to bravely dive into the

20
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:58,685
unknown and discover
what lies in your data.

21
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:02,270
There is a pervasive myth that

22
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,040
someone who works in data

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,485
should know the
everything of data.

24
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:09,050
I think that that's
unhelpful because

25
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,885
the universe of
data has expanded.

26
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:14,120
It's expanded so much

27
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,040
that specialization
becomes important.

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,430
It's very, very difficult for

29
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,915
one person to know and be
the everything of data.

30
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:25,300
That's why we need
these different roles.

31
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,210
The advice that I give folks
who are entering the space

32
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,770
is to pick their specialization
based on which flavor,

33
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,355
which type of impact best
suits their personality.

34
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:40,520
Now, data science, the discipline
of making data useful,

35
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,400
is an umbrella term that
encompasses three disciplines:

36
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,600
machine learning,
statistics, and analytics.

37
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,575
These are separated by

38
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,550
how many decisions you know

39
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,030
you want to make before
you begin with them.

40
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,180
If you want to make a few
important decisions under

41
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,175
uncertainty, that is statistics.

42
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:01,580
If you want to automate, in
other words, make many, many,

43
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,375
many decisions under uncertainty,

44
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,690
that is machine learning and AI.

45
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,030
But what if you don't know

46
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,355
how many decisions you want
to make before you begin?

47
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:13,070
What if what you're looking
for is inspiration?

48
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,980
You want to encounter
your unknown unknowns.

49
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,655
You want to understand
your world.

50
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:21,120
That is analytics.

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,450
When you're considering
data science and

52
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,885
you're choosing which
area to specialize in,

53
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:28,890
I recommend going with
your personality.

54
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,130
Which of the three excellences

55
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,485
in data science feels like
a better fit for you?

56
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:36,355
The excellence of
statistics is rigor.

57
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:39,630
Statisticians are
essentially philosophers,

58
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,335
epistemologists.

59
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:44,480
They are very, very careful about

60
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,550
protecting decision-makers
from coming

61
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,385
to the wrong conclusion.

62
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:54,035
If that care and rigor is what
you are passionate about,

63
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:56,190
I would recommend statistics.

64
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,440
Performance is the excellence of

65
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,705
the machine learning
and AI engineer.

66
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:03,945
You know that's the one for
you if someone says to you,

67
00:03:03,945 --> 00:03:05,870
"I bet that you couldn't build

68
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,630
an automation system that
performs this task with

69
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,450
99.99999 percent accuracy," and

70
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,880
your response to that
is, "Watch me."

71
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,070
How about analytics?

72
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,315
The excellence of an
analyst is speed.

73
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:24,140
How quickly can you surf
through vast amounts of

74
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,145
data to explore it and
discover the gems,

75
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:31,460
the beautiful potential
insights that are

76
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,155
worth knowing about and bringing
to your decision-makers?

77
00:03:35,155 --> 00:03:39,770
Are you excited by the
ambiguity of exploration?

78
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,145
Are you excited by the idea

79
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:46,670
of working on a lot
of different things,

80
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,535
looking at a lot of
different data sources,

81
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:52,910
and thinking through vast
amounts of information,

82
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,470
while promising not to

83
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,490
snooze past the important
potential insights?

84
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,345
Are you okay being told,

85
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:03,605
"Here is a whole lot of data.

86
00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:05,875
No one has looked at it before.

87
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,460
Go find something interesting"?

88
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,535
Do you thrive on creative,
open-ended projects?

89
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:15,695
If that's you, then

90
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:18,115
analytics is probably
the best fit for you.

91
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:19,640
A piece of advice that I have

92
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,200
for analysts getting started on

93
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,510
this journey is it can

94
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,225
be pretty scary to
explore the unknown.

95
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,090
But I suggest letting
go a little bit of

96
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,900
any temptations towards
perfectionism and instead,

97
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,330
enjoying the fun, the
thrill of exploration.

98
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,325
Don't worry about right answers.

99
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:41,660
See how quickly you
can unwrap this gift

100
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,620
and find out if there is
anything fun in there.

101
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,355
It's like your birthday,
unwrapping a bunch of things.

102
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:49,670
Some of them you like.
Some of them you won't.

103
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:54,510
But isn't it fun to know
what's actually in there?
