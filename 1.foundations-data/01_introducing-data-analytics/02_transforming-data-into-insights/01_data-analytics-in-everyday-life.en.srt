00:00:01,117 --> 00:00:02,216
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,216 --> 00:00:06,527
At this point, you've been introduced
to the world of data analytics and

3
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:07,928
what data analysts do.

4
00:00:07,928 --> 00:00:11,247
You've also learned how this
course will prepare you for

5
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:13,331
a successful career as an analyst.

6
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:16,863
Coming up, you'll learn all
the ways data can be used, and

7
00:00:16,863 --> 00:00:20,625
you'll discover why data
analysts are in such high demand.

8
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:25,211
I'm not exaggerating when I say every
goal and success that my team and

9
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:28,877
I have achieved couldn't
have been done without data.

10
00:00:28,877 --> 00:00:32,105
Here at Google,
all of our products are built on data and

11
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,038
data-driven decision making.

12
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:36,452
From concept to development to launch,

13
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:41,001
we're using data to figure out the best
way forward. And we're not alone.

14
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:45,021
Countless other organizations also
see the incredible value in data

15
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:48,696
and, of course, the data analysts
who help them make use of it.

16
00:00:48,696 --> 00:00:52,678
So we know data opens up
a lot of opportunities.

17
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:57,232
But to help you wrap your head around
all the ways you can actually use data,

18
00:00:57,232 --> 00:01:00,281
let's go over a few examples
from everyday life.

19
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:03,766
You might not realize it, but
people analyze data all the time.

20
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:06,084
For instance, I'm a morning person.

21
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:09,025
A long time ago,
I realized that I'm happier and

22
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:12,344
more productive if I get to bed
early and wake up early.

23
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:17,097
I came to this conclusion after noticing
a pattern in my day-to-day experiences.

24
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:22,248
When I got seven hours of sleep and woke
up at 6:30, I was the most successful.

25
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:27,015
So I thought about the relationship
between this pattern and my daily life,

26
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:31,943
and I predicted that early to bed early
to rise would be the right choice for me.

27
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:35,744
And I'm definitely my best self
when I wake up bright and early.

28
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,611
I bet you've identified patterns and
relationships in your life, too.

29
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:44,667
Maybe about your own sleep cycle or
how you feel after eating certain foods,

30
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,285
or what time of day you like to workout.

31
00:01:47,285 --> 00:01:51,977
All of these are great examples of
real life patterns and relationships

32
00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:56,745
that you can use to make predictions
about the right actions to take, and

33
00:01:56,745 --> 00:01:59,973
that is a huge part of
data analysis right there.

34
00:01:59,973 --> 00:02:03,468
Now, let's put this process
into a business setting.

35
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:08,220
You may remember from an earlier video
that there's a ton of data out there.

36
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,091
And every minute of every hour of
every day, more data is being created.

37
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,999
Businesses need a way to
control all that data so

38
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:20,652
they can use it to improve processes,
identify opportunities and trends,

39
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:25,253
launch new products, serve customers,
and make thoughtful decisions.

40
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:28,016
For businesses to be on
top of the competition,

41
00:02:28,016 --> 00:02:30,096
they need to be on top of their data.

42
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:34,755
That's why these companies hire data
analysts to control the waves of data they

43
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:39,917
collect every day, makes sense of it, and
then draw conclusions or make predictions.

44
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:43,436
This is the process of turning
data into insights, and

45
00:02:43,436 --> 00:02:47,729
it's how analysts help businesses
put all their data to good use.

46
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:52,819
This is actually a good way to think about
analysis: turning data into insights.

47
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:56,749
As a reminder, the more detailed
definition you learned earlier is

48
00:02:56,749 --> 00:03:00,252
that data analysis is the collection,
transformation,

49
00:03:00,252 --> 00:03:03,611
and organization of data in
order to draw conclusions,

50
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:07,271
make predictions, and
drive informed decision-making.

51
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:11,651
So after analysts have created
insights from data, what happens?

52
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:13,043
Well, a lot.

53
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:17,044
Those insights are shared with others,
decisions are made, and

54
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:18,652
businesses take action.

55
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:21,038
And here's where it can
get really exciting.

56
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:26,152
Data analytics can help organizations
completely rethink something they do or

57
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:28,681
point them in a totally new direction.

58
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:33,097
For example, maybe data leads them to
a new product or unique service, or

59
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:37,958
maybe it helps them find a new way to
deliver an incredible customer experience.

60
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:43,209
It's these kinds of aha moments that
can help businesses reach another level,

61
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,521
and that makes data analysts
vital to any business.

62
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:50,779
Now that you know more of the amazing
ways data is being used every day,

63
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:54,040
you can see why data analysts
are in such high demand.

64
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,887
We'll continue exploring how analysts can
transform data into insights that lead to

65
00:03:58,887 --> 00:03:59,431
action.

66
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:03,967
And before you know it, you'll be ready
to help any organization find new and

67
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:06,420
exciting ways to transform their data.
