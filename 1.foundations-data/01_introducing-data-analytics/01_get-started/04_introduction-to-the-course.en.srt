1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,540
"Data! Data! Data! I can't
make bricks without clay."

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,350
Any guesses who said this?
I'll give you a hint.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,975
It wasn't a famous tech CEO,

4
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:14,580
or a data analyst.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,740
The person who said this lived

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,615
long before the tech
companies even existed.

7
00:00:19,615 --> 00:00:22,545
But I bet you've
still heard of him.

8
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:25,215
This line was said
by Sherlock Holmes,

9
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:29,250
the famous detective created
by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,470
What Doyle meant was that

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,070
Holmes couldn't draw
any conclusions,

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,440
which would be the
bricks he mentioned

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,350
without data, or the clay.

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,940
You're probably
not here to become

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,500
a world famous detective,

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,440
but data is still the building
block that you'll use

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,875
for everything you do in your
new data analyst career,

18
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,890
Sherlock Holmes would agree.

19
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,760
By starting this program,

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,620
you've shown that you and

21
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,945
Sherlock Holmes have
something in common,

22
00:00:56,945 --> 00:00:59,530
you both have an interest
in learning more.

23
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,640
That's one of the most
important qualities

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,215
that data analysts can have.

25
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:06,800
Now, there are a bunch of
different ways to explore data,

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,980
but one of the great things
about data analytics is that

27
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,550
you can often learn how
you want, when you want.

28
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,370
That might mean doing
your own research,

29
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,305
talking with people
in the industry,

30
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:20,900
or taking online courses.

31
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,805
With that said, welcome
to your first course.

32
00:01:24,805 --> 00:01:26,630
This is your introduction to

33
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,255
the wonderful world
of data analytics.

34
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,300
Since data analytics is
the science of data,

35
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,790
you'll use this course to
begin to learn all about data.

36
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,335
Data is basically a
collection of facts

37
00:01:39,335 --> 00:01:41,840
or information, and
through analysis,

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,080
you'll learn how to use the
data to draw conclusions,

39
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,875
and make predictions,
and decisions.

40
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,030
Personally, I didn't jump

41
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,255
right into the data
analytics field.

42
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:55,985
I thought data analysis was
for computer engineers.

43
00:01:55,985 --> 00:02:00,064
Instead, I started off with
dreams of working in finance.

44
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,225
Once I got through an
internship though,

45
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:05,965
I realized it wasn't the
career path I wanted to take.

46
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:09,380
I started to learn about
financial planning and analysis,

47
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,475
and all of the work

48
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:12,830
finance analysts were
doing with data.

49
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,920
I realized that finance
analysts are really

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,045
just data analysts working
in a finance department.

51
00:02:19,045 --> 00:02:21,440
These analysts were
helping to guide

52
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,045
business decisions by
knowing how to use data.

53
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:28,445
It was then I realized
how powerful data is,

54
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:30,325
and I started to embrace it.

55
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:32,900
Soon enough, I realized I could

56
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,870
do this data analysis myself.

57
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,100
Data analytics is a big
open world of opportunity.

58
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,580
There are so many areas that
your analysis skills can be

59
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,335
applied and in all
different ways.

60
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,460
If you're new to this world,

61
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,770
you'll learn how to
identify which path and

62
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,140
industry might suit your skills,

63
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,350
and your interests the best.

64
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,779
For those of you who already
have some experience,

65
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,655
we'll help you open doors

66
00:03:01,655 --> 00:03:03,970
to new and exciting
opportunities.

67
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,780
One of the skills
you'll gain from

68
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,820
the program is how to follow

69
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,530
the best practices that analysts

70
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,400
use to help make
data-driven decisions.

71
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,870
Computers are one
part of the process,

72
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,380
but analysts rely on so much
more to make decisions.

73
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,540
That's why learning how
to think analytically,

74
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,760
and using your other
skills and traits

75
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,570
on the job will make
your work easier.

76
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,700
I know you already know how
to make good decisions,

77
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,700
you chose to be here after all.

78
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,420
In this first course,

79
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,340
you'll learn more
about each phase

80
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,455
of the data analysis process.

81
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:41,710
Ask, prepare, process,
analyze, share, and act.

82
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,215
As a data analyst,

83
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:45,050
you'll go through
these steps as you

84
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,300
use data to inform
your decisions.

85
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,220
Eventually, you'll see how

86
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,770
this program itself is in a way,

87
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,785
its own version of this process.

88
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:56,400
While I know you'll enjoy
watching these videos,

89
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,860
your trip to the first course

90
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,645
will include a whole lot more.

91
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:02,315
Other videos will take
the form of vignettes,

92
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:05,165
where you'll learn from data
analytics professionals,

93
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:07,960
who are already established
in their careers.

94
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,970
They'll offer words of
wisdom as well as tales of

95
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,810
their own experiences starting
off on their career path.

96
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,300
You'll start your own data
journal that will help

97
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,410
you keep track of what you've

98
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,925
learned throughout the course.

99
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:22,400
You'll also add your own
thoughts about what you're

100
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,710
learning as well,
throughout the program.

101
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,270
You'll read up on how to navigate

102
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,150
this program in the
world of data analytics.

103
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,640
You'll complete
activities, including some

104
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,475
that will help you get in the
mindset of a data analyst.

105
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,770
Along the way, you'll also have

106
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,020
the chance to connect with
your fellow learners.

107
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,430
Discussion prompts will give you

108
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,870
a chance to share your thoughts,

109
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,820
and at the same time see

110
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,435
what your peers think about
all that you're learning.

111
00:04:46,435 --> 00:04:48,650
These prompts will help you build

112
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,785
a community support system to
use throughout the program.

113
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:57,415
Enough talking, let's get
started on this exciting path.

114
00:04:57,415 --> 00:05:00,110
Your next step awaits.
