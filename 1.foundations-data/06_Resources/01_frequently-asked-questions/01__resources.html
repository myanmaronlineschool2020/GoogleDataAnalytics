  The
  <a href="https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/209818613-Enrollment-options" title="">

  </a>
  article in the Learner Help Center explains the enrollment options, including the differences between auditing a course and taking a course or specialization for a certificate.

  <strong>
   How much does it cost to enroll?
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p variant="body1">
  Enrollment in courses that are part of a specialization requires a monthly subscription as payment until you complete each of the courses.  For paid learners in the US and Canada, the program cost is $39 a month. For other countries, the cost varies; please refer to the course or specialization landing pages in your Coursera account for details. Learners in India should purchase a Learning Pass to access programs.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Learners auditing courses can access all of the content at no charge but will not be able to access graded assessments or activities. They are also not eligible to earn the full certificate. For more information, read this article about

   I answered a quiz question where there were multiple selections that applied but the ones I didn't select appear as correct. How can that be?
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p variant="body1">
  When the feedback states “Un-selected is correct” or other similar wording, that means you were correct in not selecting that answer, as that option was not one of the correct selections. A good indication that you have the right response is that the feedback under a question appears in green type.
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  <strong>
   How do I report an issue, an error, or feedback on items within the course?
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p variant="body1">
  At the bottom of each item within the course, there is a thumbs up, a thumbs down, and a flag icon. The thumbs up and thumbs down can be used to indicate how helpful or unhelpful you found the content. The flag icon alerts us that there is something that needs a correction like a grammatical error, misspelling, broken link, or other incorrect information.
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  <strong>
   I noticed that my course includes start and end dates that do not match my subscription/payment dates. Are these deadlines required?
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p variant="body1">
  The courses in this certificate program are designed to be taken at your own pace, and you can start and finish each course at any time.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  On Coursera, deadlines are set to help you stay on track and encourage you to finish content; however, you do not need to submit and pass all assignments before the session end date. If you don't finish, you can simply switch to the next session. The timeline to complete courses is ultimately decided by you!
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  <strong>
   Steps to view and edit weekly deadlines:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  If you miss two assignment deadlines in a row or miss an assignment deadline by two weeks, there will be a Reset deadlines option on the Grades page. Click it to switch to a new schedule for the course with updated deadlines. You can use this option as many times as you need.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  This won’t remove any progress you’ve already made in the course, but you may find new course content if the instructor updated the course after you started. If you cancel a subscription and then reactivate it, your deadlines will automatically reset. You can read more about this on Coursera's Learner Help Center article about

   How do I verify my name/ID?

 <p variant="body1">
  In order to receive your certificate for completing a course or specialization, you must first verify your identity. Most courses only need Name Verification, but some require ID verification. Typically, there will be a box at the top of your Accomplishments page asking you to “Verify My Name” or “Verify my ID” with a link. If this box is not there, you can follow the steps below to verify your ID for Coursera:
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  - Log in to your Coursera account.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  - Click the drop-down menu next to your name in the top right and choose Settings. Or, go directly to your settings page at:
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account-settings" title="">
   https://www.coursera.org/account-settings
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  - Scroll to the “ID Verification” section.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  - If you need to complete your ID Verification, you’ll see a Verify My ID button. If you don’t see that button, you’re not in any courses that require ID verification.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  - Click Verify My ID and follow the steps on screen.
 </p>

   I’ve completed my certification; where can I find job and career resources?
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p variant="body1">
  Congratulations on finishing the program! We recommend checking out the resources shared in the end-of-certificate checklist in the final week of the last course. This checklist shares a link to the Coursera Job Platform, available to all US-based learners, in which you can start browsing and applying to local roles in your field. It also includes access to complimentary career resources such as
  <a href="https://googlecerts.biginterview.com/" title="">
   Big Interview
  </a>
  and Career Circle. You will also receive a version of this checklist via email, as well as ongoing resources and opportunities.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Then, you'll want to create a job board platform profile. That profile will be reviewed, and once approved, you'll have access to the job board platform. We are working on creating a how-to video to help you navigate the job board platform and will update here when it is ready.
 </p>

  We are still working on expanding our reach to international employers and hope to share more updates about this soon.

  Yes -- even after stopping payments, you will retain access to all of the content that you've previously completed in a course, so that you can return to it and review lessons and submitted work.
