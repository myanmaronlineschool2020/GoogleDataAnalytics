1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,031
In an earlier video, you learned about
five essential analytical skills.

2
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:10,706
As a reminder, they're curiosity,
understanding context,

3
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:15,390
having a technical mindset,
data design, and data strategy.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,139
In the next couple of videos,
we'll explore how these

5
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:21,261
abilities all become part of
data-driven decision-making.

6
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:25,779
But first, let's look at the concept
of data-driven decision-making and

7
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:29,090
why it's more likely to lead
to successful outcomes.

8
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,199
You might remember that data-driven
decision-making involved using facts to

9
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,641
guide business strategy.

10
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:39,513
Data analysts can tap into the power of
data to do all kinds of amazing things.

11
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:44,391
With data, they can gain valuable
insights, verify their theories or

12
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:48,052
assumptions, better
understand opportunities and

13
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:52,950
challenges, support an objective,
help make a plan, and much more.

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,744
In business,

15
00:00:53,744 --> 00:00:58,321
data-driven decision-making can improve
the results in a lot of different ways.

16
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:03,007
For example, say a dairy farmer wants
to start making and selling ice cream.

17
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:05,862
They could guess what flavors
customers would like, but

18
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:08,190
there's a better way to
get the information.

19
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,142
The farmer could survey people and
ask them what flavors they prefer.

20
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:18,018
This gives the farmer the data they need
to pick ice cream flavors people will

21
00:01:18,018 --> 00:01:18,560
enjoy.

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,128
Here's another example.

23
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:24,754
Let's say the president of an organization
is curious about what perks employees

24
00:01:24,754 --> 00:01:25,498
value most.

25
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:30,812
She asked the human resources director
who says people value casual dress code.

26
00:01:30,812 --> 00:01:35,722
It's a gut feeling, but the HR director
backs it up with the fact that he sees

27
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:38,690
a lot of people wearing jeans and
t-shirts.

28
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,762
But what if this company were to use a
more structured employee feedback process,

29
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:44,874
such as a survey?

30
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:49,414
It might reveal that employees actually
enjoy free public transportation

31
00:01:49,414 --> 00:01:50,430
cards the most.

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,503
The human resources director just didn't
realize that because he drives to work.

33
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:59,805
These are just some of the benefits
of data-driven decision-making.

34
00:01:59,805 --> 00:02:02,466
It gives you greater confidence
about your choice and

35
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:04,958
your abilities to address
business challenges.

36
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:09,509
It helps you become more proactive when
an opportunity presents itself, and

37
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,880
it saves you time and
effort when working towards a goal.

38
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,193
Now let's learn more about how these five
skills help you tap into all the potential

39
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:19,047
of data-driven decision-making.

40
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:22,740
First, think about curiosity and context.

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,116
The more you learn about
the power of data,

42
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:27,559
the more curious you're likely to become.

43
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,912
You'll start to see patterns and
relationships in everyday life,

44
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:34,139
whether you're reading the news,
watching a movie, or

45
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,299
going to an appointment across town.

46
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:40,871
The analysts take their thinking
a step further by using context to make

47
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:43,305
predictions, research answers, and

48
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:47,306
eventually draw conclusions
about what they've discovered.

49
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:52,420
This natural process is a great first
step in becoming more data-driven.

50
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,148
Having a technical mindset comes next.

51
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:56,996
Everyone has instincts, or

52
00:02:56,996 --> 00:03:02,040
as in the case of our human resources
director example, gut feelings.

53
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,197
Data analysts are no different.

54
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:06,035
They have gut feelings too.

55
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:09,784
But they've trained themselves
to build on those feelings and

56
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:12,622
use a more technical
approach to explore them.

57
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:17,287
They do this by always seeking out
the facts, putting them to work through

58
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:21,971
analysis, and using the insights they
gain to make informed decisions.

59
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:23,930
Next, we come to data design,

60
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,960
which has a strong connection
to data-driven decision-making.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,561
To put it simply, designing your data so

62
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:35,457
that it is organized in a logical way makes
it easy for data analysts to access,

63
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:39,297
understand, and
make the most of available information.

64
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:43,990
And it's important to keep in mind
that data design doesn't just apply to

65
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,830
databases.

66
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,999
This kind of thinking can work with
all sorts of real-life situations too.

67
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:52,770
The basic idea is this.

68
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,917
If you make decisions that
are informed by data,

69
00:03:55,917 --> 00:04:00,309
you are more likely to make more
informed and effective decisions.

70
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:05,027
The final ability is data strategy, which
incorporates the people, processes, and

71
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:06,760
tools used to solve a problem.

72
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,691
This is a big one to remember because data
strategy gives you a high-level view of

73
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:14,695
the path you need to take
to achieve your goals.

74
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:19,519
Also, data-driven decision-making
isn't a one-person job.

75
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,470
It's much more likely to be successful if
everyone is on board and on the same page,

76
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,893
so it's important to make sure
specific procedures are in place and

77
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:33,870
that your technology being used is
aligned with your data-driven strategy.

78
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,433
Now you know how these five essential
analytical skills work towards making

79
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:40,363
better, data-driven decisions.

80
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:44,190
So far, many of the examples
you've heard are hypothetical.

81
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,078
That means they could be true in theory,
but aren't specific real-world cases.

82
00:04:49,078 --> 00:04:51,951
Next, we'll look at some real examples.

83
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:56,650
I can't wait to share how data analysts
put data to work for amazing results.
