1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,130
In this video, I'm going to share

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,480
some case studies that

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,150
highlight the incredible
work data analysts do.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,880
Each of these scenarios
shows off the power of

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,045
data-driven decision-making
in unexpected ways.

6
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:15,020
The first story is about Google.

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,385
As I mentioned a little
while back, here at Google,

8
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,900
our mission is to organize

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,565
the world's information
and make it

10
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:23,950
universally accessible
and useful.

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,360
All of our products,

12
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,700
from idea to
development to launch,

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,250
are built on data and
data-driven decision-making.

14
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,030
There are tons of examples
here at Google of

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,865
people using facts to
create business strategy.

16
00:00:36,865 --> 00:00:39,295
But one of the most famous ones

17
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:41,615
has to do with Google's
human resources.

18
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:44,330
Here's how it went.
The HR department

19
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,405
wanted to know if there was
value in having managers.

20
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:49,790
Were their contributions
worthwhile?

21
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,510
Or should everyone just be
an individual contributor?

22
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,375
To answer that question,

23
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,765
Google's people
analytics team looked

24
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,615
at past performance reviews
and employee surveys.

25
00:00:59,615 --> 00:01:01,730
The data they found
was plotted on

26
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,010
a graph because as
you've learned,

27
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,945
visuals are extremely helpful

28
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:08,765
when trying to understand
a problem or concept.

29
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:10,970
The graph revealed that Googlers

30
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,355
had positive feelings
about their managers,

31
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:15,095
but the data was pretty general

32
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:17,110
and the team wanted
to learn more.

33
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,705
So they dug deeper and split
the data into quartiles.

34
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,760
A quartile divides
data points into

35
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,175
four equal parts or quarters.

36
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:27,805
Here's where the really cool
stuff started happening.

37
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:29,735
The data analysts discovered

38
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:30,920
that there was a big difference

39
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,355
between the very top and
the very bottom quartiles.

40
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:36,590
As it turned out, the teams with

41
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,230
the best managers were
significantly happier,

42
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,510
more productive, and more

43
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,990
likely to want to keep
working at Google.

44
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,750
This confirmed that managers were

45
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,775
valued and make a big difference.

46
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:51,650
Therefore, the idea of having

47
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,910
only individual contributors
was not implemented.

48
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,940
But there was still
more work to do.

49
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,970
Just knowing that
great managers create

50
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,090
great results doesn't lead
to actionable insights.

51
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,645
You have to identify what
exactly makes a great manager,

52
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:07,070
so the team took

53
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,775
two additional steps
to collect more data.

54
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:12,845
First, they launched
an awards program

55
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:15,880
where employees could nominate
their favorite managers.

56
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,070
For every submission you
had to provide examples

57
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,565
or data about what makes
that manager great.

58
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:24,590
The second step involved

59
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,870
interviewing managers
who were graphed

60
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,655
on the top and bottom quartiles.

61
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:32,750
This helped the analytics
team see the differences

62
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,490
between successful and less

63
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,565
successful management behaviors.

64
00:02:36,565 --> 00:02:39,500
The best behaviors
were identified as

65
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,075
were the most common reasons

66
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:43,010
for a manager needing improvement.

67
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,750
The final step was sharing

68
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,610
these insights and
putting a procedure

69
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,170
in place for evaluating

70
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,315
managers with these
qualities in mind.

71
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:53,060
This data-driven decision
continues to create

72
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,980
an exceptional
company culture for

73
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,645
my colleagues and
me. Thanks, data.

74
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,980
Another interesting example comes

75
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,900
from the nonprofit sector.

76
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,724
Nonprofits are organizations
dedicated to advancing

77
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:10,595
a social cause or advocating
for a particular effort,

78
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:12,230
such as food security,

79
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,700
education or the arts.

80
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,580
In this case, data analysts

81
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,320
researched how journalists can make

82
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,820
a more meaningful impact

83
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,980
for the nonprofits
they would write about.

84
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,260
Because journalists
write for newspapers,

85
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,480
magazines, and
other news outlets,

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,660
they can help nonprofits
reach readers like you and me,

87
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,520
who then take action to

88
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,820
help nonprofits
reach their goals.

89
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,680
For instance, say you
read about the problem

90
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,370
of climate change in
an online magazine.

91
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,330
If the article is effective,

92
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,730
you'll learn more about the
cause and might even be

93
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,515
compelled to make greener choices

94
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:46,835
in your day-to-day life,

95
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:48,770
volunteer for a nonprofit,

96
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,590
or make a donation.

97
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,380
That's an example of

98
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,264
the journalist's work
bringing about awareness,

99
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:00,360
understanding, and engagement.
So, back to the story.

100
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,070
The data analysts used a tracker
to monitor story topics,

101
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,470
clicks, web traffic,
comments, shares and more.

102
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,600
Then they evaluated the
information to make

103
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,220
recommendations for
how the journalists

104
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,870
could do their jobs even better.

105
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,940
In the end, they came up with

106
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,550
some great ideas for
how nonprofits and

107
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,575
journalists can motivate people

108
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:22,865
everywhere to work together

109
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:24,470
and make the world
a better place.

110
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,090
There's really no end to what you

111
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,665
can do as a data analyst.

112
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:29,615
As you progress
through this program,

113
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:32,245
you'll discover even
more possibilities.

114
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:33,840
Great job following along with

115
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,810
the topics of these
past few videos.

116
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,240
You learned all about
analytical skills and

117
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,850
the five key characteristics
of data analysts.

118
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,980
You probably even
learned that you

119
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,520
are a pro at most
of these already.

120
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,440
Next, you discovered what it
means to think analytically

121
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,210
and the specific
skills data analysts

122
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,245
develop to help them do it.

123
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:55,610
You explored tools and

124
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,100
processes that enable
data analysts to

125
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,870
pinpoint a problem and ask

126
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,280
the right questions in
order to solve them.

127
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,390
Finally, some real-world
stories helped illustrate

128
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,280
why data-driven
decision-making is

129
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,605
usually more successful
than other methods.

130
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:11,420
You're building a
wonderful foundation

131
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,145
for your career as
a data analyst.

132
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:17,150
With every video, your skills
will continue to expand, and

133
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,010
your understanding
of key data analytics

134
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,365
concepts will only get stronger.

135
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:23,300
Soon, you'll have a chance

136
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,225
to test out everything
you've learned.

137
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,380
This is a really useful
opportunity to check

138
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,425
your understanding of all the
concepts we've discussed,

139
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:32,930
and if you're ever
unsure about a question,

140
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,400
you can review the videos and

141
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,190
readings to find the answer.

142
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,785
This is another awesome way
to practice collecting data.

143
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:42,180
Keep up the great work.
