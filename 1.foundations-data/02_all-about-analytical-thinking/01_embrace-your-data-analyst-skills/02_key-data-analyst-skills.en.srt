1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,405
Earlier, I told you that

2
00:00:03,405 --> 00:00:06,135
you already have
analytical skills.

3
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:07,980
You just might not know it yet.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,635
When learning new
things, sometimes

5
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:12,690
people overlook their own skills,

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,070
but it's important you take

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,125
the time to acknowledge them,

8
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,765
especially since these skills
are going to help you

9
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:20,160
as a data analyst.

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,415
In fact, you're probably more
prepared than you think.

11
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:24,840
Don't believe me?

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,565
Well, let me prove it.

13
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:28,380
Let's start by defining

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,835
what I'm talking about here.

15
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:33,585
Analytical skills are
qualities and characteristics

16
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:36,540
associated with solving
problems using facts.

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,030
There are a lot of aspects
to analytical skills,

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,440
but, we'll focus on
five essential points.

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,895
They are curiosity,
understanding context,

20
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:50,660
having technical mindset, data
design, and data strategy.

21
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,135
Now, you may be thinking,

22
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:55,160
"I don't have these
kinds of skills,"

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,180
or "I only have a couple of them."

24
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,680
But stay with me, and I bet
you'll change your mind.

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,660
Let's start with curiosity.

26
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,915
Curiosity is all about
wanting to learn something.

27
00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:08,990
Curious people usually seek out

28
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,120
new challenges and experiences.

29
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,620
This leads to knowledge.

30
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,920
The very fact that you're
here with me right now

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,590
demonstrates that
you have curiosity.

32
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,275
That was an easy one.

33
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:25,600
Now think about
understanding context.

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,830
Context is the condition in

35
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,795
which something
exists or happens.

36
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:31,760
This can be a structure
or an environment.

37
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,339
A simple way of
understanding context

38
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:36,035
is by counting to 5.

39
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:41,770
One, two, three, four, five.

40
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,730
All of those numbers exist in

41
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,240
the context of one through five.

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,010
But what if a friend of yours

43
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,360
said to you, one,

44
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,475
two, four, five, three?

45
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:54,095
Well, the three will
be out of context.

46
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:57,695
Simple, right? But it can
be a little tricky.

47
00:01:57,695 --> 00:02:00,260
There's a good chance that
you might not even notice

48
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,660
the three being out of context

49
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,075
if you aren't paying
close attention.

50
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:07,280
That's why listening and trying

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,755
to understand the full
picture is critical.

52
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,780
In your own life, you put

53
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,955
things into context all the time.

54
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:17,145
For example, let's think
about your grocery list.

55
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:20,420
If you group together
items like flour, sugar,

56
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,715
and yeast, that's you adding
context to your groceries.

57
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:26,415
This saves you time

58
00:02:26,415 --> 00:02:28,895
when you're at the baking
aisle at the grocery store.

59
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:30,710
Let's look at another example.

60
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,230
Have you ever shuffled a deck of

61
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,920
cards and noticed the joker?

62
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,845
If you're playing a game
that doesn't include jokers,

63
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:38,720
identifying that card means

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,895
you understand it's
out of context.

65
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,740
Remove it, and you're much

66
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,360
more likely to play
a successful game.

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,570
Now we know you have
both curiosity

68
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,975
and the ability to
understand context.

69
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:54,925
Let's move on to the third
skill, a technical mindset.

70
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,100
A technical mindset
involves the ability to

71
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,280
break things down into
smaller steps or pieces

72
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,310
and work with them in an
orderly and logical way.

73
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,085
For instance, when
paying your bills,

74
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:09,050
you probably already break down

75
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,075
the process into smaller steps.

76
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:13,070
Maybe you start by sorting them

77
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,465
by the date they're due.

78
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:16,940
Next, you might add them up and

79
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,155
compare that amount to the
balance in your bank account.

80
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:23,930
This would help you see if
you can pay your bills now,

81
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,405
or if you should wait
until the next paycheck.

82
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:29,335
Finally, you'd pay them.

83
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:32,375
When you take something that
seems like a single task,

84
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,650
like paying your bills,

85
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,600
and break it into smaller steps

86
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,310
with an orderly process,

87
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,875
that's using a technical mindset.

88
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,005
Now let's explore the fourth part

89
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:43,790
of an analytical skill set,

90
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,320
data design. Data design is
how you organize information.

91
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,615
As a data analyst, design

92
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:53,515
typically has to do
with an actual database.

93
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:55,210
But, again,

94
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,895
the same skills can easily
be applied to everyday life.

95
00:03:58,895 --> 00:04:01,160
For example, think about

96
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,635
the way you organize the
contacts in your phone.

97
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:06,190
That's actually a
type of data design.

98
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,040
Maybe you list them by
first name instead of last,

99
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,985
or maybe you use email addresses
instead of their names.

100
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:15,700
What you're really doing
is designing a clear,

101
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,900
logical list that
lets you call or

102
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,840
text a contact in a
quick and simple way.

103
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,750
The last, but
definitely not least,

104
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,430
the fifth and final element of

105
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,815
analytical skills
is data strategy.

106
00:04:27,815 --> 00:04:30,605
Data strategy is the
management of the people,

107
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:34,165
processes, and tools
used in data analysis.

108
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:35,905
Let's break that down.

109
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:37,790
You manage people
by making sure they

110
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,700
know how to use the right data

111
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,535
to find solutions to the
problem you're working on.

112
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:45,155
For processes, it's
about making sure

113
00:04:45,155 --> 00:04:48,145
the path to that solution
is clear and accessible.

114
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:50,630
For tools, you make sure

115
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,500
the right technology is
being used for the job.

116
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,350
Now, you may be
doubting my ability

117
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,530
to give you an example from

118
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,755
real life that demonstrates
data strategy.

119
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:02,275
But check this out.
Imagine mowing a lawn.

120
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:06,050
Step 1 would be reading the
owner's manual for the mower.

121
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,155
That's making sure the
people involved, or you,

122
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:12,545
in this example, know how
to use the data available.

123
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,600
The manual would
instruct you to put on

124
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,005
protective eyewear
and closed-toe shoes.

125
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:19,360
Then, it's on to step 2:

126
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,740
making the process, the
path, clear and accessible.

127
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,510
This will involve you
walking around the lawn,

128
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,710
picking up large sticks or

129
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,465
rocks that might get in your way.

130
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:31,960
Finally, for step 3,

131
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,485
you check the lawn
mower, your tool,

132
00:05:34,485 --> 00:05:37,235
to make sure it has
enough gas and oil,

133
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:39,080
and is in working condition,

134
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,925
so the lawn can be mowed safely.

135
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:43,580
There you have it. Now you know

136
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,625
the five essential skills
of a data analyst.

137
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:50,165
Curiosity, understanding context,

138
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:52,415
having a technical mindset,

139
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:55,670
data design, and data strategy.

140
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,900
I told you that you are
already an analytical thinker.

141
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,960
Now, you can start actively
practicing these skills

142
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,120
as you move through the
rest of this course.

143
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,010
Curious about what's next?

144
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,630
Move on to the next video.
