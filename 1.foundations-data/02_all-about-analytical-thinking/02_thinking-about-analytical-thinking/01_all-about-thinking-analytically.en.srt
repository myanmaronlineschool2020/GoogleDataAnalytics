1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,820
Now that you know
the five essential

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,590
skills of a data analyst,

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,150
you're ready to learn more

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,490
about what it means to
think analytically.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,145
People don't often
think about thinking.

6
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:13,650
Thinking is second nature to us.

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,620
It just happens automatically, but

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,055
there are actually many
different ways to think.

9
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:22,215
Some people think creatively,

10
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:24,135
some think critically,

11
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:26,850
and some people think
in abstract ways.

12
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,145
Let's talk about
analytical thinking.

13
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:31,890
Analytical thinking
involves identifying

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,770
and defining a problem and then

15
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,900
solving it by using data in

16
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,795
an organized, step-by-step manner.

17
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:42,475
As data analysts, how do
we think analytically?

18
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,375
Well, to answer that question,

19
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,270
we will now talk about
a second set of five.

20
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,815
The five key aspects to
analytical thinking.

21
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:55,350
They are visualization,
strategy, problem-orientation,

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,750
correlation, and finally,

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,135
big-picture and
detail-oriented thinking.

24
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:01,965
Let's start with visualization.

25
00:01:01,965 --> 00:01:04,810
In data analytics, visualization

26
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,900
is the graphical
representation of information.

27
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,909
Some examples include graphs,

28
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:12,395
maps, or other design elements.

29
00:01:12,395 --> 00:01:16,310
Visualization is important
because visuals can help

30
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,320
data analysts understand and

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,345
explain information
more effectively.

32
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:22,395
Think about it like this.

33
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:25,880
If you are trying to explain
the Grand Canyon to someone,

34
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,560
using words would be much

35
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,975
more challenging than
showing them a picture.

36
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:32,510
A visualization of the
Grand Canyon would

37
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,000
help you make your
point much quicker.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,220
Now let's talk about
the second part of

39
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,095
analytical thinking,
being strategic.

40
00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:42,004
With so much data available,

41
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:43,715
having a strategic mindset is

42
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:46,415
key to staying
focused and on track.

43
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:49,250
Strategizing helps data
analysts see what they

44
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,705
want to achieve with the data
and how they can get there.

45
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:54,560
Strategy also helps improve

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,590
the quality and usefulness
of the data we collect.

47
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,710
By strategizing, we
know all our data is

48
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,800
valuable and can help us
accomplish our goals.

49
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,580
Next step on the analytical
thinking checklist:

50
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,655
being problem-oriented.

51
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:11,420
Data analysts use a problem-

52
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,970
oriented approach in
order to identify,

53
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,520
describe, and solve problems.

54
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,470
It's all about keeping
the problem top of

55
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,930
mind throughout the
entire project.

56
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,500
For example, say a data
analyst is told about

57
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,165
the problem of a warehouse

58
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:28,300
constantly running
out of supplies.

59
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,750
They would move forward with

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,595
different strategies
and processes.

61
00:02:31,595 --> 00:02:34,040
But the number one
goal would always be

62
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,655
solving the problem of keeping
inventory on the shelves.

63
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:40,945
Data analysts also ask
a lot of questions.

64
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:43,130
This helps improve
communication and

65
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,760
saves time while
working on a solution.

66
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,495
An example of that would be

67
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:50,075
surveying customers about
their experiences

68
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:52,430
using a product and
building insights from

69
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,950
those questions to
improve their product.

70
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,780
This leads us to
the fourth quality

71
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,165
of analytical thinking:

72
00:02:58,165 --> 00:02:59,945
being able to identify

73
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:02,975
a correlation between two
or more pieces of data.

74
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:06,020
A correlation is
like a relationship.

75
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,130
You can find all kinds
of correlations in data.

76
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,690
Maybe it's the relationship
between the length of

77
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,360
your hair and the amount
of shampoo you need.

78
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,865
Or maybe you notice a
correlation between

79
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:18,680
a rainier season leading to

80
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,185
a high number of
umbrellas being sold.

81
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:24,620
But as you start identifying
correlations in data,

82
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,005
there's one thing you always
want to keep in mind:

83
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:30,535
Correlation does not
equal causation.

84
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:33,020
In other words, just
because two pieces of

85
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,509
data are both trending
in the same direction,

86
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:38,815
that doesn't necessarily
mean they are all related.

87
00:03:38,815 --> 00:03:40,740
We'll learn more
about that later.

88
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,190
Now the final piece of

89
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,735
the analytical thinking
puzzle: big-picture thinking.

90
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:48,200
This means being able to see

91
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,480
the big picture as
well as the details.

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,195
A jigsaw puzzle is a great
way to think about this.

93
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:54,950
Big-picture thinking is like

94
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,525
looking at a complete puzzle.

95
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:58,940
You can enjoy the
whole picture without

96
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,110
getting stuck on every tiny

97
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,930
piece that went into making it.

98
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,224
If you only focus on
individual pieces,

99
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:07,985
you wouldn't be able
to see past that,

100
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:11,735
which is why big-picture
thinking is so important.

101
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:13,760
It helps you zoom out and

102
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,180
see possibilities
and opportunities.

103
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,805
This leads to exciting
new ideas or innovations.

104
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:23,240
On the flip side, detail-oriented
thinking is all about

105
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,980
figuring out all of the aspects

106
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,900
that will help you
execute a plan.

107
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,505
In other words, the pieces
that make up your puzzle.

108
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:32,390
There are all kinds
of problems in

109
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,430
the business world
that can benefit from

110
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,920
employees who have
both a big-picture

111
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,780
and a detail-oriented
way of thinking.

112
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,425
Most of us are naturally
better at one or the other.

113
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:42,860
But you can always develop

114
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,350
the skills to fit
both pieces together.

115
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,330
Now that you know
the five aspects

116
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,665
of analytical thinking,

117
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:52,305
visualization, strategy,
problem-orientation,

118
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:53,880
correlation, and

119
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,175
big-picture and
detail-oriented thinking,

120
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:57,440
you can put them to work for

121
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,450
you when you're
working with data.

122
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,510
As you continue through this
course, you'll learn how.
