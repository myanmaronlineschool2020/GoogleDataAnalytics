1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,430
Let's recap what we've learned

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,500
about analytical thinking so far.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,475
The 5 key aspects are
visualization, strategy,

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,080
problem-orientation,

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,465
correlation, and
using big-picture

6
00:00:12,465 --> 00:00:14,580
and detail-oriented thinking.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,560
We've seen how you already

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,735
use them in your everyday life.

9
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:21,090
We also talked about
how different people

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,340
naturally use certain
types of thinking,

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,950
but that you can absolutely
grow and develop

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,280
the skills that might not
come as easily to you.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,130
This means you can become
a versatile thinker,

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,920
which is a very important
part of data analysis.

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,395
You might naturally be
an analytical thinker,

16
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:39,240
but you can learn to
think creatively

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,480
and critically, and be
great at all three.

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,375
The more ways you can think,

19
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,100
the easier it is to think outside

20
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,695
the box and come up
with fresh ideas.

21
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:51,730
But why is it important to
think in different ways?

22
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,364
Well because in data
analysis, solutions

23
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:56,170
are almost never right
in front of you.

24
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,710
You need to think critically to

25
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,215
find out the right
questions to ask.

26
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:02,285
But you also need
to think creatively

27
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:04,945
to get new and
unexpected answers.

28
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:07,400
Let's talk about some
of the questions data

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,625
analysts ask when they're on
the hunt for a solution.

30
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,220
Here's one that
will come up a lot:

31
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,370
What is the root
cause of a problem?

32
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,355
A root cause is the reason
why a problem occurs.

33
00:01:19,355 --> 00:01:22,475
If we can identify and
get rid of a root cause,

34
00:01:22,475 --> 00:01:25,450
we can prevent that problem
from happening again.

35
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,530
A simple way to wrap
your head around

36
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,430
root causes is with the
process called the Five Whys.

37
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,545
In the Five Whys you ask

38
00:01:33,545 --> 00:01:37,480
"why" five times to
reveal the root cause.

39
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,460
The fifth and final
answer should give you

40
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,645
some useful and sometimes
surprising insights.

41
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:47,150
Here's an example of the
Five Whys in action.

42
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,710
Let's say you wanted to make

43
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,725
a blueberry pie but couldn't
find any blueberries.

44
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:54,410
You've been trying to
solve a problem by asking,

45
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,605
why can't I make a blueberry pie?

46
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:58,710
The answer will be, there

47
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,705
are no blueberries at the store.

48
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:03,375
There's Why Number 1.

49
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:07,385
You then ask, why were there
no blueberries at the store?

50
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:09,710
Then you discover that the
blueberry bushes

51
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,555
don't have enough
fruit this season.

52
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:13,775
That's Why Number 2.

53
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:17,355
Next, you'd ask, why was
there not enough fruit?

54
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:19,110
This would lead to the fact that

55
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,150
birds were eating
all the berries.

56
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,465
Why Number 3, asked and answered.

57
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:27,075
Now we get to Why Number 4.

58
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:31,055
Ask why a fourth time and
the answer would be that,

59
00:02:31,055 --> 00:02:33,050
although the birds
normally prefer

60
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,540
mulberries and don't
eat blueberries,

61
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,450
the mulberry bush didn't
produce fruit this season,

62
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,155
so the birds are eating
blueberries instead.

63
00:02:41,155 --> 00:02:44,070
Finally, we get to Why Number 5,

64
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,080
which should reveal
the root cause.

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,725
A late frost damaged
the mulberry bushes,

66
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:51,055
so it didn't produce any fruit.

67
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:53,405
You can't make a blueberry pie

68
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:55,850
because of the late
frost months ago.

69
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,115
See how the Five Whys can reveal

70
00:02:58,115 --> 00:03:00,265
some very surprising root causes.

71
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:03,200
This is a great trick
to know, and it can be

72
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,350
a very helpful process
in data analysis.

73
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,145
Another question commonly
asked by data analysts is,

74
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:12,425
where are the gaps
in our process?

75
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,660
For this, many people will use

76
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,820
something called gap analysis.

77
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,060
Gap analysis lets you examine
and evaluate how a process

78
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,800
works currently in order

79
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,905
to get where you want
to be in the future.

80
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,210
Businesses conduct gap analysis

81
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,950
to do all kinds of things,

82
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,640
such as improve a product
or become more efficient.

83
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,915
The general approach
to gap analysis is

84
00:03:32,915 --> 00:03:34,535
understanding where you are now

85
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:36,580
compared to where you want to be.

86
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,100
Then you can identify the
gaps that exist between

87
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,540
the current and future state

88
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,655
and determine how to bridge them.

89
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:46,430
A third question that data
analysts ask a lot is,

90
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,430
what did we not consider before?

91
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,710
This is a great way to think
about what information

92
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,750
or procedure might be
missing from a process,

93
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,780
so you can identify ways to make

94
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,485
better decisions and
strategies moving forward.

95
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:01,970
These are just a few
examples of the kinds of

96
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,225
questions data analysts
use at their jobs every day.

97
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:06,920
As you begin your career,

98
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,400
I'm sure you'll think
of a whole lot more.

99
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,215
The way data analysts
think and ask questions

100
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:15,320
plays a big part in how
businesses make decisions.

101
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,195
That's why analytical thinking

102
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:18,740
and understanding how to ask

103
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,120
the right questions can have

104
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,480
such a huge impact on the
overall success of a business.

105
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,720
Later, we'll talk more
about how data-driven

106
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,570
decisions can lead to
successful outcomes.
