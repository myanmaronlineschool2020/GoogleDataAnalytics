00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,885
Welcome back. In the
next few videos,

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:05,200
you'll continue to explore

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,195
the data analytics tools
we discussed earlier,

4
00:00:08,195 --> 00:00:09,940
and you'll get the chance to see

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,815
them in action a little bit.

6
00:00:11,815 --> 00:00:13,765
This will give you
a clearer picture

7
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:15,655
of how to use these tools.

8
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:17,320
The rest of the program will

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,495
build on from what
you learn here.

10
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:22,640
We'll start with a closer
look at spreadsheets.

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,900
We'll break spreadsheets
down to their basics to

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,185
better understand a few of
their features and functions.

13
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:31,480
You'll also learn how
you might want to use

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,015
them in your work
as a data analyst.

15
00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:35,890
For example, how do you

16
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,515
sort data to make
it easier to use?

17
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:42,040
We'll find out. Next, we'll see

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,660
SQL in action. Data analysts

19
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,435
use SQL in their
work all the time.

20
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:49,970
Like when they need a
large amount of data in

21
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,224
seconds to help answer a
quick business question.

22
00:00:53,224 --> 00:00:58,110
Chances are, you're not
familiar with SQL. That's okay.

23
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,830
You'll learn how using
SQL is just like

24
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,860
ordering food at a super
speedy restaurant.

25
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,380
Your SQL query might not be as

26
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,970
delicious but you won't

27
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,240
have to wait long
to get your order.

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,100
Speaking of food, what
better topic than dessert?

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,580
You can think of data
visualization as

30
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,820
the dessert to the meal
of data analytics.

31
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,380
It's served at the end of

32
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,570
your analysis after
you've done what you

33
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,475
need to get the right data
for a question or task.

34
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:29,240
We've already seen that

35
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,805
visualizations come
in a lot of forms,

36
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:33,815
like graphs or charts.

37
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:37,300
Just like dessert, they're
a treat to look at.

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,340
You'll learn more about
these visual representations

39
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,220
and see other examples
of how they might look.

40
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,160
Then you'll get to talk
about visualizations

41
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,295
with other future data
analysts just like yourself.

42
00:01:49,295 --> 00:01:51,850
We'll wrap things up
with an assessment,

43
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,180
but you'll have time to

44
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,580
review what you've
learned before then.

45
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,220
Okay, let's keep going.

46
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,010
By the way, is anyone
else hungry now?
