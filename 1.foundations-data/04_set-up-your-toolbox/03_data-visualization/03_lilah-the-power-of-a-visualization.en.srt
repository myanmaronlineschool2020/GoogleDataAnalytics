My name is Lilah Jones, and
I am a part of our cloud team.

3
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:13,199
I get a chance to lead a team of amazing
individuals that are focused on helping

4
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,882
customers get to the cloud.

5
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:18,293
Data visualizations,
that's a long word and

6
00:00:18,293 --> 00:00:21,270
that can also make your eyes glaze over.

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,499
But I wonder if, when you were little and
you were with your parents,

8
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:27,340
maybe they had a bedtime routine or
maybe you have children,

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,421
you're doing a bedtime routine with them.

10
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:33,486
You very rarely are going to come to
those children with a bunch of facts and

11
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:35,440
figures before they go to bed.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,184
But I bet you probably are telling them
a story, you're showing them pictures,

13
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:43,618
I know I always loved comic books,
pictures tell a story.

14
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:48,539
Data visualizations are pictures,
they are a wonderful way to take

15
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,348
very basic ideas around data and
data points and make them come alive.

16
00:00:54,348 --> 00:00:59,258
You can do all different types of
combinations of visualizations,

17
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:03,489
but the ones that are interactive,
wow, those are huge.

18
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:07,256
Can you imagine being executive of an
organization and

19
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:12,119
trying to figure out how
should we open up another site in Bangkok?

20
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,969
Does that make sense and
us being able to walk in and saying,

21
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:18,675
here's why it makes sense in having
great data visualizations to support all

22
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:21,540
of our points of view,
makes it a no brainer.

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,973
Interestingly enough, I do recall
the first time I came across a super

24
00:01:25,973 --> 00:01:29,365
amazing visualization,
it was in my personal life.

25
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:33,497
I switched my budgeting software
from one provider to another, and

26
00:01:33,497 --> 00:01:38,206
the provider that I switched to was really
focused on every dollar has a job and

27
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:41,413
making sure you're budgeting,
every single dollar.

28
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:45,574
They gave visualizations that change,
depending on what input you would add

29
00:01:45,574 --> 00:01:49,615
to it and it really just changed my
entire perspective, the entire thing.

30
00:01:49,615 --> 00:01:52,756
So having the data is like having
the answer sheet for a test,

31
00:01:52,756 --> 00:01:57,068
it really just lets you know that you're
going to make good decisions because it's

32
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:58,070
backed up by data.
