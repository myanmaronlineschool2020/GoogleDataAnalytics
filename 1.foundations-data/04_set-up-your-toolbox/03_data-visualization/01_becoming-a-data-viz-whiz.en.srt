1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,845
Your data analysis
toolbox is getting full.

2
00:00:04,845 --> 00:00:07,200
Learning about both
Spreadsheets and

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,995
SQL will get you far in the
world of data analysis.

4
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:12,900
There's more to learn, of course,

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,855
and lots more tools
you'll be able to use,

6
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:17,955
but your future is
looking bright.

7
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:20,085
It's about to look even brighter,

8
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:25,425
because we're here to talk
more about data visualization.

9
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,500
I'll tell you a little
more about the role of

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,585
data visualization tools
and data analytics,

11
00:00:31,585 --> 00:00:33,440
and give you a chance to see

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,040
those tools in action
later in this video.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,190
You might remember that
data visualization

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,085
is the graphical
representation of information.

15
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,870
For tons of data analysts,

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,220
it's the most exciting part of

17
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,020
their job because they get to

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,490
see their hard work pay off
with something interesting.

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,005
Not to mention that
data visualization

20
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:56,030
is beautiful and useful.

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,490
I was floored when
I got to Google and

22
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,710
started to get a
quarterly data report in

23
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,180
my e-mail and had

24
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,530
a big slide deck where

25
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,320
people contributed
their visualizations.

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,930
It was definitely a
source of light as I

27
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,065
started to build my
own visualizations.

28
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:14,810
If you're not
impressed by my story,

29
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,765
let me tell you about
Florence Nightingale.

30
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:19,745
Does that name ring a bell?

31
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:21,890
She is responsible for much of

32
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,215
the philosophy of modern nursing,

33
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:25,775
and believe it or not,

34
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:28,250
she was also a data analyst.

35
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,000
During the Crimean
War in the 1850s,

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,065
thousands of soldiers
were dying every day,

37
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:37,040
Nightingale wanted to find a way

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,095
to reduce the number of deaths.

39
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:41,045
After examining the data,

40
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:42,650
she found that the majority of

41
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,075
soldiers were dying from
preventable conditions.

42
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:48,290
To convince hospital
administrators

43
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,645
that they needed to focus
on these conditions,

44
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:52,430
she created a chart showing

45
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,890
the number of deaths
over several months.

46
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,350
The much larger blue sections in

47
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,970
the visualization represent
the preventable deaths.

48
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,600
Her work directly led to major
changes in patient care.

49
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,670
She did all of this over

50
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,905
150 years ago without a computer.

51
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:14,720
One of the main reasons
Nightingale created

52
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,970
this visualization was to make

53
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,795
the data easier to
digest for her audience.

54
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:21,150
She felt she'd be more

55
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,240
successful convincing
the stakeholders

56
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,080
using visuals instead of
just words and numbers.

57
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,125
She was right, tables
filled with data,

58
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,425
while necessary for analysis,

59
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:36,290
just aren't able to show
trends and patterns as

60
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,830
quickly and clearly as
visualizations can.

61
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,020
Imagine, you receive
an assignment that

62
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,060
needs to be completed
the same day.

63
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,925
You gather the data
you need in a table,

64
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:50,390
could you explain your
findings using the table?

65
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,635
Yes, you probably could,

66
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:54,860
but a better idea will be to use

67
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,835
a visualization like
this bar graph.

68
00:02:57,835 --> 00:03:00,335
Something like this makes it much

69
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:02,615
easier for you to
explain quickly,

70
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,220
and you've got the benefit of

71
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,375
a cool graphic to
backup your analysis.

72
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,065
As a data analyst,

73
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:11,270
you'll want to create
visualizations that

74
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,355
make the data easy to understand,

75
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:16,535
and interesting to look
at, so show it off.

76
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:18,200
Stakeholders may not have

77
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,245
much time to devote to the data,

78
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:23,955
your job will be to make
their time worthwhile.

79
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,940
Let's go back to
that data table we

80
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,175
created earlier in the course.

81
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,589
If you created your
own for practice,

82
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:33,800
you can open it up now
or try this out later.

83
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,070
Here's the data we added before.

84
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,110
Let's create a
visualization of the data

85
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,865
by inserting a
chart, a bar graph.

86
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:46,279
You can see that the
spreadsheet visualized

87
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:47,600
the data from our table in

88
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,745
a way that made the most sense.

89
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:51,710
It created a bar graph or

90
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,539
column chart to compare the
ages of each person by name,

91
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:58,025
but you might have
figured that out already.

92
00:03:58,025 --> 00:04:00,995
That's the beauty
of visualization,

93
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:04,915
it shows data analysis
quickly and clearly.

94
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:07,980
We can use chart editor
to adjust the chart.

95
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,070
Different spreadsheet
programs might

96
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,855
have different ways to do this,

97
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:14,435
but they all have
visualization functions

98
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:17,545
and ways to edit
those visualizations.

99
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:21,500
For now, let's just look
at the suggested charts.

100
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,410
We can make the bars go
horizontally using a bar chart.

101
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,850
That looks great, so let's
close the Chart editor.

102
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,055
There are lots of
options to look at,

103
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:36,325
but we'll keep it basic for now.

104
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:39,095
Feel free to try
other visualizations

105
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:40,810
if you practice later.

106
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,220
Now, we can adjust
our chart to make

107
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,190
our whole spreadsheet look
clean and professional.

108
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,325
Excellent. I hope
you learn to love

109
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:52,910
data visualization
as much as I do.

110
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,970
Maybe you'll become a data
visualization pioneer,

111
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,850
just like Florence Nightingale.

112
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,825
As a budding data analysts,

113
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:02,720
you started to fill
your utility belt with

114
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,235
valuable tools that you'll

115
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:06,865
use throughout the
rest of the program.

116
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:10,590
Having spreadsheets, SQL
and data visualization

117
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,460
know-how will help make
you an ace data detective.

118
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,210
You'll be able to use
these tools throughout

119
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,720
the data analytics process
as you move forward.

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,880
Coming up next, you complete

121
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,045
a few activities to wrap up
this part of the program.

122
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:28,370
You'll also complete
an assessment to

123
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,265
check your understanding
of all that you learn.

124
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:33,350
This is a great opportunity to

125
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,150
think about some
of the areas that

126
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,665
you'll continue to explore

127
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:39,280
in this course and
in your career.

128
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,560
As always, feel free to
review the videos and

129
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,505
readings to help remind you
of certain topics and ideas,

130
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:49,045
even if you already
feel prepared.

131
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:52,145
You're just a few steps
away from the next course,

132
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:55,830
that's great
progress. Keep it up.
