1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,010
As you might remember, earlier

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,800
we touched on the
query language SQL.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,170
In this video, you'll see SQL in

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,220
action and learn what
you can do with it,

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,060
with some examples
of specific queries.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,190
I guess you can call
this the SQL sequel.

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,980
We'll try to make this one
even better than the original.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,880
Remember, SQL can do lots of

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,055
the same things with data
that spreadsheets can do.

10
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:29,980
You can use it to store,

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,195
organize and analyze your
data, among other things.

12
00:00:34,195 --> 00:00:36,400
But like any good sequel,

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,115
it's on a larger scale,
bigger, more action-packed.

14
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:44,445
Think of it as
supersize spreadsheets.

15
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:47,020
For example, you might
want to consider

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,615
a spreadsheet when you
have a smaller dataset,

17
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:52,285
such as one with just 100 rows.

18
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,390
But if your data set
seems to go on forever,

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,615
and your spreadsheet is
struggling to keep up,

20
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:01,165
SQL would be the way to go.

21
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:03,370
When you use SQL, you need

22
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,940
a place where the SQL
language is understood.

23
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,260
If you've ever gone somewhere
and not known the language,

24
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,745
it can be challenging
to communicate.

25
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:15,610
You might think
you're asking for

26
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,685
one thing and get something
completely different.

27
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:21,375
Well, SQL knows the feeling.

28
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:25,895
SQL needs a database that
will understand its language.

29
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:28,600
Let's talk. There are a number

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,315
of databases out
there that use SQL.

31
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:33,250
You may use several of them

32
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,495
during your time
as a data analyst.

33
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,185
But here's the thing,

34
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:39,340
no matter which
database you use,

35
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,685
SQL basically works
for the same in each.

36
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:46,600
For example, in SQL,
queries are universal.

37
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,805
We've talked about
queries before,

38
00:01:48,805 --> 00:01:51,265
but it never hurts
to have a refresher.

39
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:53,920
A query is a request for

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,145
data or information
from a database.

41
00:01:57,145 --> 00:01:59,920
Here's the structure
of a basic query.

42
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,650
You can see that
with this query we

43
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,020
can select specific data from

44
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,840
a table by adding where we can

45
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,495
filter the data based
on certain conditions.

46
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:15,790
Let's get started. We'll open
our database and see how

47
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,380
SQL can communicate with it
to do some simple data task.

48
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,665
First, let's select
our dataset.

49
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:25,330
We'll use an asterisk to

50
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,000
select all of the
data from the table.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,010
With that simple query,

52
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,920
the database calls up
the table we need.

53
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:47,615
Magic. Let's add Where

54
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:52,130
to our query to show how that
changes what data we get.

55
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,870
You can see the data
now only shows,

56
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,230
movies that are in
the action genre.

57
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,305
That's it, a basic query in SQL.

58
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:10,370
Pretty cool, huh? Soon you'll

59
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,165
learn about building
more complex queries.

60
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:15,380
For now, though,
we can celebrate

61
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,670
learning about the structure
of a basic SQL query,

62
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,840
select, from, and where.

63
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,005
As you continue the program,

64
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:27,455
you have the opportunity
to use SQL yourself.

65
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:29,360
I hope this video was

66
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,000
a useful sneak peek at
what's coming later.
