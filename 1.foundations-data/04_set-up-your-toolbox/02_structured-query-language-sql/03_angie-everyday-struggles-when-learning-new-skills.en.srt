1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,050
I'm Angie, I'm a Program Manager

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,565
of Engineering at Google.

3
00:00:08,565 --> 00:00:12,435
I'm currently working on the
Data Analytics certificate.

4
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:15,630
Previously, I was a researcher
in people analytics.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,330
I was also what I call
an analytical mercenary

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,950
working for a lot of
different companies

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,690
to help them make
sense of their data.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,255
Every time I learn a new skill,

9
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:28,140
I feel like I'm learning how
to speak all over again.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,675
I remember the first
time I learned SQL,

11
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:33,645
I was so frustrated because
everyone around me,

12
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:35,400
it felt like they were fluent,

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,390
they knew exactly
what they were doing.

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,385
I remember struggling with
the most basic things,

15
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:44,750
just like getting the data out
of the table or I remember

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,060
somebody asked me just
to find an average

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,490
of something and I kept
on getting an error.

18
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,900
It really does feel like you're

19
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,880
learning a new
language and you're

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,320
at toddler level and

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,545
everyone around you
is like maybe fluent.

22
00:00:56,545 --> 00:00:57,890
My parents immigrated to

23
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,720
this country when they
are in their 30s.

24
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,655
After they had learned

25
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:03,410
another language and
they had to start

26
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,900
over and learn English.

27
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,155
I remember as a
child watching them

28
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:12,125
struggle every day to
pick up a new language,

29
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,955
to do really basic things,

30
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:16,520
like ask for help at
the grocery store.

31
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,730
I remember calling the cable
company when I was six,

32
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,560
asking them questions about

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,410
the bill because my
parents couldn't.

34
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,660
I remember how hard
they worked to

35
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,420
learn this new
language and to become

36
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,090
fluent and every
time I'm learning

37
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,410
a new data language like

38
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,605
SQL or R, I think about how
hard that must have been.

39
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:40,845
I think if they can do
that, I can learn SQL.

40
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:43,310
If they can ask for help for
the most basic of things,

41
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,795
I can ask the Data
Analysts next to me how

42
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:47,000
to write a SQL statement and

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,410
how to get data out of a table.

44
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,045
That really helped me,

45
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:51,440
is just having that mindset

46
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,270
and knowing that I
can ask for help.
