1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,030
Regardless of what type of

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,370
data analysis you're conducting,

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,470
the process is
generally the same.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,810
The example that I'll
walk through is that

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,210
of our employee engagement
survey, but you could

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,250
imagine that this process
applies to just about

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,545
any data analysis that you're

8
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:20,355
going to conduct as an analyst.

9
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,560
The first thing you
want to do is ask.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,090
You want to ask all of

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,410
the right questions at

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,690
the beginning of the
engagement so that

13
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,940
you better understand what

14
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,060
your leaders and stakeholders
need from this analysis.

15
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,810
The types of questions that
I generally ask are around,

16
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,945
what is the problem that
we're trying to solve?

17
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:42,780
What is the purpose
of this analysis?

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,835
What are we hoping
to learn from it?

19
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:46,220
After you've asked all the

20
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,810
right questions
and you've wrapped

21
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,040
your arms around the scope of

22
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,900
the analysis you need to conduct,

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,915
the next step is to prepare.

24
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:55,400
We need to be thinking
about what type of

25
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,800
data we need to answer
those key questions.

26
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,630
This could be anything from

27
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,030
quantitative data or
qualitative data.

28
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,850
It could be cross-sectional
or points in

29
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,815
time versus longitudinal
over a long period of time.

30
00:01:08,815 --> 00:01:11,000
We need to be thinking
about the type of data

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,100
we need in order to
answer the questions

32
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,320
that we've set out
to answer based on

33
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,995
what we learned when we
asked the right questions.

34
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,850
We also need to be thinking about

35
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,760
how we're going to
collect that data

36
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,005
or if we need to
collect that data.

37
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:25,790
It may be the case that

38
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,075
we need to collect
this data brand-new.

39
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:29,780
So we need to think
about what type of

40
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,955
data we're going to be
collecting and how.

41
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:34,175
For our employee engagement survey,

42
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:35,750
we do that via survey of

43
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,840
both quantitative and
qualitative questions.

44
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,810
But it may actually be the
case that for many analyses,

45
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,720
the data that you're
looking for already exist.

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,280
Then it's a question of working

47
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,840
with those data
owners to make sure

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,950
that you are able to leverage

49
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,170
that data and use it responsibly.

50
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,395
After you've done all the hard
work to collect your data,

51
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:56,885
now you need to
process that data.

52
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:58,930
It begins with cleaning.

53
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,280
This to me is the most fun part

54
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,755
of the data analytics process.

55
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:06,740
We can think of it as
the initial introduction

56
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,180
or the handshake,

57
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,755
hello, to your data.

58
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,060
This is where you get a chance

59
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,280
to understand its structure,

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,470
its quirks, its nuances,

61
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,750
and you really get a
chance to understand

62
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,090
deeply what type of
data you're going to

63
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,220
be working with and understanding

64
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,810
what potential that data has

65
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,880
to answer all of your questions.

66
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,085
This is such an important
part, too,

67
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:29,810
where we're running
through all of

68
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,760
our quality assurance checks.

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,980
For example, do we have all of

70
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,620
the data that we
anticipated we would have?

71
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,830
Are we missing data at
random or is it missing in

72
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,780
a systematic way such that

73
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,980
maybe something went wrong with

74
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,650
our data collection effort?

75
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,185
If needed, did we code all
of our data the right way?

76
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:51,755
Are there any outliers that
we need to treat differently?

77
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,200
This is the part
where we spend a lot of

78
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,440
time really digging deeply into

79
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,380
the structure and nuance of
the data to make sure that

80
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,550
you're able to analyze

81
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,755
it appropriately
and responsibly.

82
00:03:03,755 --> 00:03:05,630
After cleaning our
data and running

83
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,730
all of our quality
assurance checks,

84
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,595
now is the point where
we analyze our data,

85
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:12,485
making sure to do so in as

86
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:15,475
objective and unbiased
a way as possible.

87
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:17,810
To do this, the first
thing we do is run

88
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,135
through a series of
analyses that we've

89
00:03:20,135 --> 00:03:22,640
already planned
ahead of time based

90
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,020
on the questions that we know we

91
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,400
want to answer from the very,

92
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,110
very beginning of the process.

93
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,220
One thing that's probably the

94
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,410
hardest about this
particular process,

95
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,405
the hardest thing
about analyzing data,

96
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:37,015
is that we as analysts are
trained to look for patterns.

97
00:03:37,015 --> 00:03:40,580
Over time as we become better
and better at our jobs,

98
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,650
what we'll often find
is that we can start to

99
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,110
intuit what we might
see in the data.

100
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,850
We might have a
sneaking suspicion

101
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,760
as to what the data
are going to tell us.

102
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,200
This is the point where
we have to take a step

103
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,310
back and let the data
speak for itself.

104
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,365
As data analysts, we
are storytellers,

105
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:59,210
but we also have to
keep in mind that it

106
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,190
is not our story to tell.

107
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,335
That story belongs to the data,

108
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:06,920
and it is our job as
analysts to amplify and

109
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,360
tell that story in

110
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,790
as unbiased and objective
a way as possible.

111
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,370
The next step is to share
all of the data and

112
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,115
insights that you've
generated from your analyses.

113
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:18,800
Now typically for employee
engagement survey,

114
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,750
we start by sharing the
high-level findings

115
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,340
with our executive team.

116
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,230
We want them to have
a landscape view of

117
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,090
how the organization is feeling,

118
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,530
and we want to make sure
that there aren't

119
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,300
any surprises as they dig

120
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,160
deeper and deeper
into the data to

121
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,305
understand how teams are feeling

122
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:35,675
and how individual
employees are feeling.

123
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,310
All of this work

124
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,075
from asking the right questions
to collecting your data,

125
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:43,130
to analyzing and sharing,

126
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,720
doesn't mean much of anything

127
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,205
if we aren't taking action
on what we've just learned.

128
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:51,410
This to me is the
most critical part,

129
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,080
especially of our employee
engagement survey.

130
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,319
I like to say that the survey
is actually the easy part,

131
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,790
and acting on the results is

132
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,145
really where the
real work begins.

133
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:04,490
This is where we use all of
those data-driven insights to

134
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,090
decide what types of interventions
we want to introduce,

135
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,830
not only at the
organizational level,

136
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,175
but also at the
team level as well.

137
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:14,060
We might find, for example,

138
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,700
that the organization is
working on a series of

139
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,980
interventions to help improve

140
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,825
part of the employee experience,

141
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:22,370
whereas individual teams have

142
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,965
additional roles,
responsibilities to play,

143
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:28,970
to either bolster some of
those efforts or to introduce

144
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,250
new ones to better
meet their team

145
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,970
where their strengths and
opportunity areas are.

146
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,430
The data analysis
process is rigorous,

147
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,180
but it is lengthy.

148
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,790
I can completely appreciate
that we as data analysts,

149
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,595
get so excited about just

150
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:50,785
diving right into the data
and doing what we do best.

151
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:53,300
The challenge is that if we don't

152
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,910
work through the process
in its entirety,

153
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,965
if we try to skip steps,

154
00:05:57,965 --> 00:05:59,930
we're not going to
be able to elicit

155
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,425
the insights that
we're looking for.

156
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:03,970
I absolutely love my job.

157
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,555
I have such a deep
appreciation for

158
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:10,130
data and what it can do and

159
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,560
what type of insight
we can derive from it.
