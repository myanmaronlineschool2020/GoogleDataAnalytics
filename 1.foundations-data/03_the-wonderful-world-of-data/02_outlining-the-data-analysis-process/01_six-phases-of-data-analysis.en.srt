1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,475
Now that you understand

2
00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:04,590
all the phases of
the data life cycle,

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,085
it's time to move on to the
phases of data analysis.

4
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:11,520
They sound similar, but
are two different things.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,370
Data analysis isn't a life cycle.

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,070
It's the process
of analyzing data.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,890
Coming up, we'll
look at each step of

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,260
the data analysis process and how

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,155
it will relate to your
work as a data analyst.

10
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:28,485
Even this program is designed
to follow these steps.

11
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:31,140
Understanding these
connections will help guide

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,710
your own analysis and your
work in this program.

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,395
You've already learned that
this program is modeled

14
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:40,630
after the stages of the
data analysis process.

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,935
This program is
split into courses,

16
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:46,655
six of which are based upon
the steps of data analysis:

17
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:53,430
ask, prepare, process,
analyze, share, and act.

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,580
Let's start with
the first step in

19
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,475
data analysis, the ask phase.

20
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,430
In this phase, we do two things.

21
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,070
We define the problem to
be solved and we make

22
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,310
sure that we fully understand
stakeholder expectations.

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,120
Stakeholders hold a
stake in the project.

24
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,360
They are people who have

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,490
invested time and resources into

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,305
a project and are interested

27
00:01:15,305 --> 00:01:17,555
in the outcome. Let's
break that down.

28
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:20,330
First, defining a problem
means you look at

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,040
the current state and identify

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,260
how it's different
from the ideal state.

31
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,750
Usually there's an obstacle
we need to get rid

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,900
of or something wrong
that needs to be fixed.

33
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,630
For instance, a sports
arena might want to

34
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,840
reduce the time fans spend
waiting in the ticket line.

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,270
The obstacle is
figuring out how to get

36
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,990
the customers to their
seats more quickly.

37
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,385
Another important
part of the ask phase

38
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:46,615
is understanding
stakeholder expectations.

39
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:48,170
The first step here is to

40
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,615
determine who the
stakeholders are.

41
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:52,985
That may include your manager,

42
00:01:52,985 --> 00:01:56,080
an executive sponsor,
or your sales partners.

43
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,265
There can be lots
of stakeholders.

44
00:01:58,265 --> 00:01:59,780
But what they all have in

45
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,165
common is that they
help make decisions,

46
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,159
influence actions and strategies,

47
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,875
and have specific goals
they want to meet.

48
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,380
They also care about the
project and that's why

49
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,080
it's so important to
understand their expectations.

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,510
For instance, if your
manager assigns you

51
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,405
a data analysis project
related to business risk,

52
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:19,730
it would be smart to confirm
whether they want to

53
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,835
include all types of risks
that could affect the company,

54
00:02:22,835 --> 00:02:24,260
or just risks related to

55
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,120
weather such as
hurricanes and tornadoes.

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,630
Communicating with your
stakeholders is key in making

57
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,800
sure you stay engaged

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,540
and on track throughout
the project.

59
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,310
So as a data analyst,

60
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,634
developing strong
communication strategies

61
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:37,790
is very important.

62
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,950
This part of the ask phase helps

63
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,320
you keep focused on
the problem itself,

64
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,185
not just its symptoms.

65
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:45,755
As you learned earlier,

66
00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:48,950
the five whys are
extremely helpful here.

67
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,750
In an upcoming course,

68
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,390
you'll learn how to ask
effective questions

69
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,554
and define the problem by
working with stakeholders.

70
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:59,570
You'll also cover strategies
that can help you

71
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,145
share what you discover

72
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:02,930
in a way that keeps
people interested.

73
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,880
After that, we'll move on to

74
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,925
the prepare step of the
data analysis process.

75
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:10,940
This is where data analysts
collect and store data

76
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,925
they'll use for the
upcoming analysis process.

77
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:15,950
You'll learn more about
the different types

78
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,870
of data and how to identify

79
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,370
which kinds of data are most

80
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,995
useful for solving a
particular problem.

81
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:24,740
You'll also discover why
it's so important that

82
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,770
your data and results are
objective and unbiased.

83
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,504
In other words, any decisions
made from your analysis

84
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:32,780
should always be based on

85
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,530
facts and be fair and impartial.

86
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,695
Next is the process step.

87
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:40,685
Here, data analysts
find and eliminate

88
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:42,545
any errors and inaccuracies

89
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:44,530
that can get in the
way of results.

90
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,580
This usually means cleaning data,

91
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,340
transforming it into a
more useful format,

92
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,650
combining two or more
datasets to make

93
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,724
information more complete
and removing outliers,

94
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:56,450
which are any data points that

95
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,280
could skew the information.

96
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,530
After that, you'll learn
how to check the data you

97
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,035
prepare to make sure it's
complete and correct.

98
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,660
This phase is all about
getting the details right.

99
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,355
So you'll also fix typos,

100
00:04:07,355 --> 00:04:10,615
inconsistencies, or missing
and inaccurate data.

101
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:12,225
To top it off,

102
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:13,880
you'll gain strategies for

103
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,080
verifying and sharing

104
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,095
your data cleansing
with stakeholders.

105
00:04:17,095 --> 00:04:19,680
Then it's time to analyze.

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,650
Analyzing the data
you've collected

107
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,599
involves using tools to transform

108
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:25,235
and organize that information

109
00:04:25,235 --> 00:04:27,320
so that you can draw
useful conclusions,

110
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,490
make predictions, and drive
informed decision-making.

111
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,140
There are lots of powerful
tools data analysts use in

112
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,460
their work and in

113
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,455
this course you'll learn
about two of them,

114
00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:39,215
spreadsheets and
structured query language,

115
00:04:39,215 --> 00:04:43,150
or SQL, which is often
pronounced "sequel."

116
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,800
The next course is based
on the share phase.

117
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,360
Here you'll learn how

118
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,195
data analysts interpret
results and share them with

119
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:52,070
others to help stakeholders

120
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,820
make effective
data-driven decisions.

121
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,255
In the share phase,

122
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:59,660
visualization is a data
analyst's best friend.

123
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,300
So this course will highlight
why visualization is

124
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,070
essential to getting others to

125
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,220
understand what your
data is telling you.

126
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,475
With the right visuals,

127
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:10,310
facts and figures become
so much easier to

128
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,940
see and complex concepts
become easier to understand.

129
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,010
We'll explore different
kinds of visuals

130
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,310
and some great data
visualization tools.

131
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,760
You'll also practice

132
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,680
your own presentation
skills by creating

133
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,750
compelling slideshows
and learning

134
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,690
how to be fully prepared
to answer questions.

135
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,690
Then we'll take a break from
the data analysis process to

136
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,540
show you all of the really
cool things you can do with

137
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,390
the programming language
R. You don't need to be

138
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,845
familiar with R or programming
languages in general.

139
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:41,330
Just know that R is
a popular tool for

140
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,950
data manipulation, calculation,
and visualization.

141
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,240
For our final data analysis
phase, we have act.

142
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,110
This is the exciting moment when

143
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,570
the business takes all
of the insights you,

144
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,920
the data analyst, have

145
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,680
provided and puts them to
work in order to solve

146
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,735
the original business
problem and will be

147
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,855
acting on what you've learned
throughout this program.

148
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:05,465
This is when you prepare
for your job search

149
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,450
and have the chance to
complete a case study project.

150
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,210
It's a great opportunity
for you to bring together

151
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,925
everything you've worked
on throughout this course.

152
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:15,860
Plus adding a case study

153
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,690
to your portfolio helps you stand

154
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,265
out from the other
candidates when you

155
00:06:19,265 --> 00:06:21,670
interview for your
first data analyst job.

156
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,330
Now you know the
different steps of

157
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,800
the data analysis process and
how our course reflects it.

158
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,490
You have everything you need

159
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,230
to understand how this course

160
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,420
works and my fellow Googlers and

161
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,450
I will be here to guide
you every step of the way.
