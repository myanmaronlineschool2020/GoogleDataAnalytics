1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,160
I'm looking forward to introducing you to
some of the tools data analyst use each

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,360
and every day.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,100
There are tons of options out there.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,320
But the most common ones you'll
see analyst use are spreadsheets,

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,100
query languages and visualization tools.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,800
And this video is going to give you
a quick look at how these tools are being

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,170
used by data analysts everyday.

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,320
Believe it or not,
I was several years into my accounting and

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,230
finance career before I saw all
of these tools working together.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,510
At that point I was very
experienced with spreadsheets,

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:36,430
and had worked in large data sets with some
of the traditional database programs.

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,550
I had the foundational skill
set to use query languages, and

13
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,580
I had dabbled in visualizations, but
I had never brought them all together.

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,850
Then I got hired here at Google.

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,650
And it was so
eye-opening to come into a place like

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,790
this with an abundance of
information everywhere you look.

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:00,560
As an analyst at Google, the true power of
these tools became so much clearer to me.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,420
I became more focused on really maximizing
everything these tools could do,

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,500
streamlining my reporting and
just making my work simpler.

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,980
All of the sudden, I had a lot more time
and space to dedicate to identifying

21
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,430
new problems to solve and
driving decision-making.

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,010
Without a doubt, once you've
learned the power of these tools,

23
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,970
you will be well on your way to
becoming the best data analyst you

24
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,282
can possibly be.

25
00:01:24,282 --> 00:01:28,550
All right, I hope that story has you
even more motivated for this course.

26
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,670
Let's get started with spreadsheets.

27
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,170
Again, there are lots of different
spreadsheet solutions, but

28
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,510
two popular options
are Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.

29
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,920
To put it simply, a spreadsheet is
a digital worksheet. It stores,

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,110
organizes, and sorts data.

31
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,320
This is important because the usefulness
of your data depends on how well it's

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,370
structured.

33
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,060
When you put your data into a spreadsheet,
you can see patterns,

34
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,860
group information and
easily find the information you need.

35
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,570
Spreadsheets also have some really useful
features called formulas and functions.

36
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,480
A formula is a set of instructions
that performs a specific

37
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,740
calculation using the data
in a spreadsheet.

38
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,790
Formulas can do basic things like add,
subtract, multiply and

39
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,660
divide, but they don't stop there.

40
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,640
You can also use formulas to find
the average of a number set.

41
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,355
Look up a particular value,

42
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:28,200
return the sum of a set of values that
meets a particular rule, and so much more.

43
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,560
A function is a preset command that
automatically performs a specific

44
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,640
process or
task using the data in a spreadsheet.

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,320
That sounds pretty technical,
I know, so let's break it down.

46
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,520
Just think of a function as a simpler,

47
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,290
more efficient way of doing something
that would normally take a lot of time.

48
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,860
In other words, functions can
help make you more efficient.

49
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,900
Those are the spreadsheet basics for now.

50
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,120
Later on, you'll see them in action and
start working with spreadsheets yourself.

51
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,380
The next data analysis tool
is called query language.

52
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,060
A query language is a computer programming
language that allows you to retrieve and

53
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,375
manipulate data from a database.

54
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,070
You'll learn something called
structured query language,

55
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,530
more commonly known as SQL.

56
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,360
SQL is a language that lets data
analysts communicate with a database.

57
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,390
A database is a collection of
data stored in a computer system.

58
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:28,490
SQL is the most widely used structured
query language for a couple of reasons.

59
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:33,380
It's easy to understand and works very
well with all kinds of databases.

60
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,590
With SQL, data analysts can access
the data they need by making a query.

61
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,060
Although query means question, I like
to think of it as more of a request.

62
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,770
So you're requesting that
the database do something for you.

63
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,520
You can ask it to do a lot of different
things such as insert, delete,

64
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,875
select or update data.

65
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:58,050
Okay, that's a top level look at SQL.

66
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,550
In a later video,
we'll explore it further and

67
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,950
use SQL to do some really
cool things with data.

68
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,630
Lastly, let's talk about
data visualization.

69
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,050
You've learned that data visualization
is the graphical representation of

70
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,050
information.

71
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,140
Some examples include graphs,
maps, and tables.

72
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,860
Most people process visuals
more easily than words alone.

73
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,329
That's why visualizations are so
important.

74
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,370
They help data analysts communicate their
insights to others, in an effective and

75
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,800
compelling way.

76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,300
When you think about the data analysis
process, after data is prepared,

77
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,130
processed and analyzed,

78
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,160
the insights are visualized so
it can be understood and shared.

79
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,200
This makes it easier for
stakeholders to draw conclusions,

80
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,150
make decisions, and
come up with strategies.

81
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,000
Some popular visualization
tools are Tableau and Looker.

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,880
Data analysts like using Tableau because
it helps them create visuals that are very

83
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,150
easy to understand.

84
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,610
This means that even non-technical users
can get the information they need.

85
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,670
Looker is also popular with data
analysts because it gives them

86
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,040
an easy way to create visuals
based on the results of a query.

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,580
With Looker, you can give stakeholders
a complete picture of your work

88
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,090
by showing them visualization data and
the actual data related to it.

89
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,670
All visualization tools have great
features that are useful in different

90
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,730
situations.

91
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:27,500
Soon you will learn how to decide which
tool to use for a particular job.

92
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,910
And that's everything you need to
know about the data life cycle and

93
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,130
the data analysis process.

94
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,760
You'll get a chance to
test out what you know, so

95
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,750
you can feel confident moving
forward in this course.

96
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,810
Feel free to take some time to
re-familiarize yourself with

97
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,390
the concepts and when you're ready,
give it your best shot.

98
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,680
If you're ever unsure of an answer,
you can always go back and

99
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,570
review the videos and readings.

100
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,310
Then you'll be ready to move
on to the next set of videos,

101
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,350
where we'll continue exploring the data
analytics tools you've already covered.

102
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:03,158
And you'll get some really fascinating
insights into exactly how they work.

103
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:07,550
Before long, you'll have the knowledge and
confidence to start using them yourself.

104
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,380
Stay tuned.
