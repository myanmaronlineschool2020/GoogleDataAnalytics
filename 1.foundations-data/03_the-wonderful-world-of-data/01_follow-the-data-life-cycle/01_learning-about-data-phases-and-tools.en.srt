1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,525
Hey. It's great to have you back.

2
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:05,190
We've talked a little bit about

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,110
the data analysis process.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,640
As a quick refresher,

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,250
the data analysis process phases

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,085
are ask, prepare, process,

7
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:16,845
analyze, share, and act.

8
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:19,140
You might remember
me saying earlier

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,485
that this entire program is
modeled after these steps.

10
00:00:22,485 --> 00:00:25,350
Now, we're going
to really dig in

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,065
and explore how each of
these phases work together.

12
00:00:28,065 --> 00:00:30,060
But I'm getting a
little ahead of myself.

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,205
First, let's spend a little time

14
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:34,350
understanding the data life cycle.

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,340
No, data isn't actually alive,

16
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,675
but it does have a life cycle.

17
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:41,735
How do data analysts

18
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:43,310
bring data to life?

19
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,825
Well, it starts with the
right data analysis tool.

20
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:50,015
These include
spreadsheets, databases,

21
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:53,560
query languages, and
visualization software.

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,700
Don't worry if you don't
know how these work,

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,490
or even what they are.

24
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,920
At one point, every data analyst

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,020
has been right where
you are right now,

26
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,370
and they probably had a
lot of the same questions.

27
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,200
I remember when I first started

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,745
learning about spreadsheets.

29
00:01:10,745 --> 00:01:12,470
I was a young intern,

30
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,240
and the company I
was working for

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,625
was in the middle of
a big systems change.

32
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:19,010
That meant, we had
to move tons of

33
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,225
reports from the old
system to the new one.

34
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:23,835
After a few weeks,

35
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:25,740
I noticed that even the people

36
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,685
who were further
in their careers

37
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:31,205
were not as technically
minded as I was.

38
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:35,300
That became a great opportunity
for me to add value.

39
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,580
My aha spreadsheet moment

40
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,890
came when I started
researching shortcuts

41
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,090
that I could use to work with

42
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,785
the spreadsheets
more efficiently.

43
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:44,990
This would really
streamline the process of

44
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,765
getting those reports moved
over to the new system.

45
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:49,625
Once everything started flowing,

46
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,080
I remember getting emails from

47
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,000
other finance analysts
at the company.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,530
They were so grateful

49
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,790
that someone had come in

50
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,790
and fixed a problem
that no one else could.

51
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,850
That inspired me to
go even further

52
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,450
and learn how to
use spreadsheets

53
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,920
in all sorts of incredible ways.

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,020
As you continue
through this course,

55
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,690
I bet you'll be just
as impressed as I was.

56
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,580
And before you know
it, you'll bring data

57
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,630
to life too. Let's get started.
