1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,990
In this video, I'm going to share

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,345
an interesting data
analytics case study,

3
00:00:05,345 --> 00:00:07,250
it will illustrate how problem

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,455
solving relates to each phase of

5
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:11,840
the data analysis
process and shed

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,665
some light on how these phases
work in the real world.

7
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:18,290
It's about a small
business that used data

8
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,155
to solve a unique
problem it was facing.

9
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:24,590
The business is called
Anywhere Gaming Repair.

10
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,470
It's a service provider
that comes to you to

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,770
fix your broken video game
systems or accessories.

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,300
The owner wanted to
expand his business.

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,760
He knew advertising is

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,904
a proven way to get
more customers,

15
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:39,505
but he wasn't sure
where to start.

16
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:42,860
There are all kinds of different
advertising strategies,

17
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,685
including print, billboards,
TV commercials,

18
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:51,105
public transportation,
podcasts, and radio.

19
00:00:51,105 --> 00:00:54,020
One of the key things to
think about when choosing

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,354
an advertising method is
your target audience,

21
00:00:57,354 --> 00:00:58,790
in other words, the

22
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,300
specific people you're
trying to reach.

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,820
For example, if a medical
equipment manufacturer

24
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,365
wanted to reach doctors,

25
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:07,670
placing an ad in

26
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,295
a health magazine would
be a smart choice.

27
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:13,970
Or if a catering company
wanted to find new cooks,

28
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,040
it might advertise using a poster

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,415
at a bus stop near
a cooking school.

30
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:20,630
Both of these are
great ways to get

31
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,850
your ad seen by your
target audience.

32
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,760
The second thing to think
about is your budget and

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,155
how much the different
advertising methods will cost.

34
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:32,000
For instance, a TV ad is likely

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,640
to be more expensive
than a radio ad.

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,860
A large billboard
will probably cost

37
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,000
more than a small poster
on the back of a city bus.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,590
The business owner
asked a data analyst,

39
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,990
Maria, to make a recommendation.

40
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,730
She started with
the first step in

41
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,610
the data analysis process, Ask.

42
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,410
Maria began by defining

43
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,380
the problem that
needed to be solved.

44
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,790
To do this, she first had to zoom

45
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,625
out and look at the whole
situation in context.

46
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,670
That way she could be sure
that she was focusing on

47
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,225
the real problem and
not just its symptoms.

48
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,580
This leads us to
another important part

49
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,365
of the problem solving process,

50
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:11,450
collaborating with stakeholders

51
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,720
and understanding their needs.

52
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,640
For Anywhere Gaming
Repair, stakeholders

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,080
included the owner,

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,315
the vice president
of communications,

55
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:23,120
and the director of
marketing and finance.

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,100
Working together, Maria and

57
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,125
the stakeholders
agreed on the problem,

58
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,220
not knowing their target audience's

59
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,745
preferred type of advertising.

60
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:34,245
Next step was the prepare phase,

61
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:36,050
where Maria collected data for

62
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,205
the upcoming analysis process.

63
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:40,430
But first, she needed to better

64
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,220
understand the company's
target audience,

65
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,650
people with video game systems.

66
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,570
After that, Maria collected

67
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,245
data on the different
advertising methods.

68
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:53,480
This way, she would be able
to determine which was

69
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,390
the most popular one with the
company's target audience.

70
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,450
Then she moved on to
the process step.

71
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,394
Here Maria cleaned
the data to eliminate

72
00:03:03,394 --> 00:03:05,375
any errors or inaccuracies

73
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,795
that could get in the
way of the result.

74
00:03:07,795 --> 00:03:10,640
As we've learned,
when you clean data,

75
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,085
you transform it into
a more useful format,

76
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:17,605
create more complete information
and remove outliers.

77
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:20,390
Then it was time to analyze.

78
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,485
In this step, Maria wanted
to find out two things.

79
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:28,445
First, who's most likely to
own a video gaming system?

80
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:30,560
Second, where are these people

81
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,915
most likely to see
an advertisement?

82
00:03:32,915 --> 00:03:36,380
Maria, first discovered that
people between the ages of

83
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,540
18 and 34 are most

84
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,395
likely to make video
game related purchases.

85
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:43,610
She could confirm that Anywhere

86
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,560
Gaming Repair's
target audience was

87
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,545
people 18-34 years old.

88
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:51,275
This was who they should
be trying to reach.

89
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:52,700
With this in mind,

90
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,580
Maria then learned that
both TV commercials and

91
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,410
podcasts are very popular

92
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,360
with people in the
target audience.

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,300
Because Maria knew
Anywhere Gaming Repair had

94
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,340
a limited budget and

95
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,159
understanding the high
cost of TV commercials,

96
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,440
her recommendation
was to advertise in

97
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,260
podcasts because they are
more cost-effective.

98
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,210
Now that she had her analysis,

99
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,100
it was time for Maria to share

100
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,230
her recommendation so the company

101
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,495
could make a data
driven decision.

102
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:22,580
She summarized her results using

103
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,455
clear and compelling
visuals of the analysis.

104
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:27,230
This helped her stakeholders

105
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,895
understand the solution
to the original problem.

106
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,240
Finally, Anywhere Gaming
Repair took action,

107
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,305
they worked with a local
podcast production agency

108
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:39,570
to create a 30 second ad
about their services.

109
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,430
The ad ran on podcast for
a month, and it worked.

110
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,750
They saw an increase in

111
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,075
customers after just
the first week.

112
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:48,920
By the end of week 4,

113
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,575
they had 85 new
customers. There you go.

114
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:54,650
Effective problem solving using

115
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,370
data analysis phases in action.

116
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,510
Now, you've seen
how the six phases

117
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,600
of data analysis can
be applied to problem

118
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,640
solving and how you can use that

119
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,790
to solve real world problems.
