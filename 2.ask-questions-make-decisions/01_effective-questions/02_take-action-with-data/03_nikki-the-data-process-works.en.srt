1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,885
I'm Nikki and I
manage the education,

2
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:09,135
evaluation, assessment,
and research team.

3
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:12,960
My favorite part of the data
analysis process is finding

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,360
the hardest problem and asking

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,460
a million questions about it and

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,115
seeing if it's even
possible to get an answer.

7
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:22,680
One of the problems that
we've tackled here at

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,035
Google is our Noogler
onboarding program,

9
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:27,570
which is how we
onboard new hires.

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,929
One of the things that we've
done is ask the question,

11
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,060
how do we know whether or

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,595
not Nooglers are
onboarding faster

13
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:37,620
through our new
onboarding program than

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,615
our old onboarding program
where we used to lecture them.

15
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:44,450
We worked really closely with
the content providers to

16
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,060
understand just exactly what

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,975
does it mean to onboard
someone faster?

18
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:52,154
Once we asked all the questions,

19
00:00:52,154 --> 00:00:53,790
what we did is we prepared

20
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,800
the data by understanding who was

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,760
the population of the new
hires that we were examining.

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,160
We prepared our data by going

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,040
through and understanding
who our populations were,

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,400
by understanding who
our sample set was,

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,695
who our control group was,

26
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,230
who our experiment group was,

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,240
where were our data sources,

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,590
and make sure that it
was in a set, in a format that was

29
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,855
clean and digestible for

30
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:23,065
us to write the
proper scripts for.

31
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:24,470
So the next step for us was to

32
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,195
process the data to
make sure that it was

33
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:29,330
in a format that we could
actually analyze in SQL,

34
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,459
making sure that was
in the right format,

35
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,824
in the right columns,

36
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:34,705
and in the right tables for us.

37
00:01:34,705 --> 00:01:36,120
To analyze the data,

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,045
we wrote scripts in SQL and
in R to correlate the data to

39
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:43,520
the control group or
the experiment group

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,370
and interpret the
data to understand,

41
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,230
were there any changes in

42
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,465
the behavioral
indicators that we saw?

43
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:52,250
Once we analyze all the data,

44
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,260
we want to report on it in a way

45
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,450
that our stakeholders
could understand.

46
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,475
Depending on who our
stakeholders were,

47
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:00,859
we prepared reports, dashboards

48
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:03,500
and presentations, and shared
that information out.

49
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,645
Once all of our
reports were complete,

50
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:08,540
we saw really positive
results and decided to act on

51
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,680
it by continuing

52
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,940
our project-based learning
onboarding program.

53
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,870
It was really satisfying to
know that we have the data to

54
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,465
support it and that
it really, really worked.

55
00:02:18,465 --> 00:02:20,810
And not just that the data was there,

56
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,940
but that we knew
that our students

57
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,205
were learning and that
they were more productive,

58
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:27,840
faster back on their jobs.
