1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,445
In a previous video,

2
00:00:02,445 --> 00:00:04,680
I shared how data
analysis helped a company

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,575
figure out where to
advertise its services.

4
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:09,540
An important part
of this process

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,870
was strong
problem-solving skills.

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,455
As a data analyst,

7
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:15,570
you'll find that problems
are at the center

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,790
of what you do every single day,

9
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,275
but that's a good thing.

10
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:22,470
Think of problems as opportunities
to put your skills to

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,160
work and find creative
and insightful solutions.

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,920
Problems can be small or large,

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,020
simple or complex,

14
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,280
no problem is like another
and they all require

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,155
a slightly different approach

16
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:38,635
but the first step
is always the same:

17
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:40,910
Understanding what kind of
problem you're trying to

18
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,170
solve and that's what we're
going to talk about now.

19
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,060
Data analysts work with
a variety of problems.

20
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,540
In this video, we're going to
focus on six common types.

21
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,635
These include: making
predictions, categorizing things,

22
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:58,774
spotting something unusual,
identifying themes,

23
00:00:58,774 --> 00:01:03,250
discovering connections,
and finding patterns.

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,090
Let's define each of these now.

25
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,220
First, making predictions.

26
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,480
This problem type involves
using data to make

27
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,040
an informed decision about

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,410
how things may be in the future.

29
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,980
For example, a hospital
system might use

30
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,230
a remote patient monitoring to

31
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,530
predict health events for
chronically ill patients.

32
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,910
The patients would take

33
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,645
their health vitals
at home every day,

34
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:33,080
and that information combined
with data about their age,

35
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,770
risk factors, and other
important details could enable

36
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,975
the hospital's
algorithm to predict

37
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:40,670
future health problems and

38
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,510
even reduce future
hospitalizations.

39
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,790
The next problem type
is categorizing things.

40
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,100
This means assigning
information to

41
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,015
different groups or clusters
based on common features.

42
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:55,610
An example of this
problem type is

43
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,560
a manufacturer that
reviews data on

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,845
shop floor employee performance.

45
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:02,720
An analyst may create
a group for employees

46
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,885
who are most and least
effective at engineering.

47
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:08,510
A group for employees
who are most and least

48
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,600
effective at repair
and maintenance,

49
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,595
most and least
effective at assembly,

50
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:17,360
and many more
groups or clusters.

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,445
Next, we have spotting
something unusual.

52
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:22,145
In this problem type,

53
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:24,605
data analysts identify data

54
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:26,675
that is different from the norm.

55
00:02:26,675 --> 00:02:28,730
An instance of
spotting something

56
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,920
unusual in the real world is

57
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,300
a school system that has

58
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,930
a sudden increase in the
number of students registered,

59
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,430
maybe as big as

60
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,160
a 30 percent jump in
the number of students.

61
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,140
A data analyst might look into

62
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,300
this upswing and discover that

63
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,880
several new apartment
complexes had been

64
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,745
built in the school
district earlier that year.

65
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:53,000
They could use this analysis
to make sure the school has

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,390
enough resources to handle
the additional students.

67
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,915
Identifying themes is
the next problem type.

68
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:03,380
Identifying themes takes
categorization as a step

69
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,060
further by grouping information
into broader concepts.

70
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,030
Going back to our
manufacturer that has just

71
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,990
reviewed data on the
shop floor employees.

72
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,510
First, these people are
grouped by types and tasks.

73
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,670
But now a data analyst could

74
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,950
take those categories
and group them into

75
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,570
the broader concept of

76
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,620
low productivity and
high productivity.

77
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,970
This would make it possible
for the business to

78
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,270
see who is most and
least productive,

79
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,540
in order to reward
top performers and

80
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,580
provide additional support to

81
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,620
those workers who
need more training.

82
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,220
Now, the problem type of
discovering connections enables

83
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,480
data analysts to find

84
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,050
similar challenges faced
by different entities,

85
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,725
and then combine data and
insights to address them.

86
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:53,495
Here's what I mean;

87
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:55,970
say a scooter company
is experiencing

88
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,335
an issue with the wheels it
gets from its wheel supplier.

89
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:02,510
That company would have to
stop production until it could

90
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,885
get safe, quality
wheels back in stock.

91
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:08,570
But meanwhile, the wheel
companies encountering

92
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,725
the problem with the rubber
it uses to make wheels,

93
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:14,180
turns out its rubber
supplier could

94
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,035
not find the right
materials either.

95
00:04:17,035 --> 00:04:19,580
If all of these entities
could talk about

96
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,535
the problems they're facing
and share data openly,

97
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:23,750
they would find a lot of

98
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,330
similar challenges
and better yet,

99
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,125
be able to collaborate
to find a solution.

100
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,330
The final problem type
is finding patterns.

101
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,340
Data analysts use data to find

102
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,920
patterns by using
historical data to

103
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,450
understand what happened in

104
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,175
the past and is therefore
likely to happen again.

105
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:44,330
Ecommerce companies use data to

106
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,400
find patterns all the time.

107
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,670
Data analysts look at
transaction data to understand

108
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,830
customer buying habits at

109
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,475
certain points in time
throughout the year.

110
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:56,580
They may find that
customers buy more

111
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,860
canned goods right
before a hurricane,

112
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,729
or they purchase fewer
cold-weather accessories

113
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:04,670
like hats and gloves
during warmer months.

114
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,560
The ecommerce companies can

115
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,390
use these insights to make sure

116
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,100
they stock the right amount of

117
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,865
products at these key times.

118
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:16,130
Alright, you've now learned six
basic problem types

119
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,530
that data analysts
typically face.

120
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,390
As a future data analyst,

121
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,455
this is going to be valuable
knowledge for your career.

122
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:25,370
Coming up, we'll talk a bit more

123
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,170
about these problem
types and I'll

124
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,180
provide even more
examples of them

125
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,505
being solved by data analysts.

126
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:34,595
Personally, I love
real-world examples.

127
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:38,275
They really help me better
understand new concepts.

128
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:39,780
I can't wait to share

129
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,660
even more actual cases
with you. See you there.
