Hi, I'm Anmol.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,910
I'm the Head of Large
Advertiser Marketing Analytics

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,725
within the Marketing
Team at Google.

4
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:12,990
At its core, my job
is about connecting

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,810
the right user with the right
message at the right time.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,520
The first step is really to get

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,460
a broad sense of the certain
pattern that's occurring.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,310
So for example, we know that
this particular segment

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,460
of users is more responsive
to this type of content.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,320
Once we're able to actually see

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,165
this hypothesis through the data,

12
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:31,980
we do testing to ensure

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,870
that the hypothesis
is actually correct.

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,935
So for example, we would test

15
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:39,785
sending these pieces of content
to this segment of users,

16
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:42,730
and actually verify within
a controlled environment

17
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,700
whether that response rate is

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,620
actually higher for
that type of content,

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,940
or whether it isn't.

20
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,810
Once we're able to actually
verify that hypothesis,

21
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,670
we go back to the stakeholders,

22
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,215
in this case, our
marketers, and say,

23
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:59,465
we've proven within a relatively
high degree of certainty

24
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:01,580
that this particular
segment is more

25
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,760
responsive to this type of
content, and because of that,

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,900
we're recommending that you

27
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,820
produce more of this
type of content.

28
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,370
Our stakeholders
really get to see

29
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,755
the whole evolution from
hypothesis to proven concept,

30
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:18,034
and they're able to

31
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:21,110
come with us on the journey
on how we're proving out

32
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,750
these hypotheses and then
eventually turning them

33
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,190
into strategies and
recommendations for the business.

34
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,760
The outcome in this
case was that we

35
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,935
were able to actually change the way

36
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:33,245
our whole marketing team worked

37
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:36,365
to actually make it
much more user-centric.

38
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:38,780
Instead of, from our perspective,

39
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,900
coming up with content that
we think the users need,

40
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,820
we're actually going in
the other direction of

41
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,740
figuring out what
users need first,

42
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,970
proving that they need

43
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,280
certain things or they
don't need certain things,

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,725
and then using that information
going back to marketers

45
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:54,370
and coming up with content
that fulfills their need.

46
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,270
So it really changed
the direction of

47
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,910
how we produce things.
