1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,719
You've been learning about six common
problem types of data analysts encounter,

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:12,085
making predictions, categorizing things,
spotting something unusual,

3
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:17,310
identifying themes, discovering
connections, and finding patterns.

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,240
Let's think back to our real world
example from a previous video.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,493
In that example,

6
00:00:22,493 --> 00:00:27,770
anywhere gaming repair wanted to figure
out how to bring in new customers.

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,388
So the problem was, how to determine
the best advertising method for

8
00:00:32,388 --> 00:00:35,350
anywhere gaming repair's target audience.

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,770
To help solve this problem,
the company used data to envision

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,140
what would happen if it
advertised in different places.

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,556
Now nobody can see the future but
the data helped them make an informed

12
00:00:48,556 --> 00:00:51,780
decision about how things
would likely work out.

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,500
So, their problem type
was making predictions.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,740
Now let's think about the second
problem type, categorizing things.

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,666
Here's an example of a problem
that involves categorization.

16
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:10,320
Let's say a business wants to improve
its customer satisfaction levels.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,817
Data analysts could review recorded
calls to the company's customer

18
00:01:14,817 --> 00:01:19,640
service department and evaluate
the satisfaction levels of each caller.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,000
They could identify certain key words or
phrases that come up during

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,794
the phone calls and then assign them
to categories such as politeness,

21
00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:34,080
satisfaction, dissatisfaction,
empathy, and more.

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,784
Categorizing these key words gives
us data that lets the company

23
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:43,664
identify top performing customer
service representatives, and

24
00:01:43,664 --> 00:01:46,390
those who might need more coaching.

25
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,432
This leads to happier customers and
higher customer service scores.

26
00:01:51,432 --> 00:01:57,310
Okay, now let's talk about a problem that
involves spotting something unusual.

27
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,640
Some of you may have a smart watch,
my favorite app is for health tracking.

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,337
These apps can help people stay healthy by
collecting data such as their heart rate,

29
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:11,970
sleep patterns,
exercise routine, and much more.

30
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,738
There are many stories out there
about health apps actually saving

31
00:02:15,738 --> 00:02:16,830
people's lives.

32
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,569
One is about a woman who was young,
athletic, and

33
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:23,440
had no previous medical problems.

34
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,372
One night she heard
a beep on her smartwatch,

35
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:29,480
a notification said her
heart rate had spiked.

36
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,570
Now in this example think of
the watch as a data analyst.

37
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,140
The watch was collecting and
analyzing health data.

38
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,758
So when her resting heart rate was
suddenly 120 beats per minute,

39
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:46,378
the watch spotted something unusual
because according to its data,

40
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:49,190
the rate was normally around 70.

41
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,476
Thanks to the data her smart watch gave
her, the woman went to the hospital and

42
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:57,762
discovered she had a condition which
could have led to life threatening

43
00:02:57,762 --> 00:03:00,860
complications if she hadn't
gotten medical help.

44
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,280
Now let's move on to the next type
of problem: identifying themes.

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,420
We see a lot of examples of this
in the user experience field.

46
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,824
User experience designers study and

47
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:17,040
work to improve the interactions people
have with products they use every day.

48
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,070
Let's say a user experience designer
wants to see what customers think about

49
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,500
the coffee maker his
company manufactures.

50
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,267
This business collects anonymous
survey data from users,

51
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:30,000
which can be used to answer this question.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,156
But first to make sense of it all,

53
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:36,468
he will need to find themes that
represent the most valuable data,

54
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:41,410
especially information he can use to
make the user experience even better.

55
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,529
So the problem the user experience
designer's company faces,

56
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:49,610
is how to improve the user experience for
its coffee makers.

57
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,948
The process here is kind of
like finding categories for

58
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:56,720
keywords and phrases in
customer service conversations.

59
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,618
But identifying themes goes even
further by grouping each insight into

60
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:02,860
a broader theme.

61
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,030
Then the designer can pinpoint
the themes that are most common.

62
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,930
In this case he learned users often
couldn't tell if the coffee maker

63
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,960
was on or off.

64
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,470
He ended up optimizing the design with
improved placement and lighting for

65
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:24,150
the on/off button, leading to the product
improvement and happier users.

66
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,500
Now we come to the problem
of discovering connections.

67
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,039
This example is from
the transportation industry and

68
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,580
uses something called
third party logistics.

69
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,070
Third party logistics partners
help businesses ship products when

70
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,650
they don't have their own trucks,
planes or ships.

71
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,402
A common problem these partners face is
figuring out how to reduce wait time.

72
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:52,160
Wait time happens when a truck driver
from the third party logistics provider

73
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,250
arrives to pick up a shipment but
it's not ready.

74
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,820
So she has to wait.

75
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,685
That costs both companies time and
money and

76
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:04,460
it stops trucks from getting back on
the road to make more deliveries.

77
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,760
So how can they solve this?

78
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,349
Well, by sharing data the partner
companies can view each other's timelines

79
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:15,540
and see what's causing
shipments to run late.

80
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,220
Then they can figure out how to
avoid those problems in the future.

81
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,180
So a problem for one business doesn't
cause a negative impact for the other.

82
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,704
For example, if shipments are running late
because one company only delivers Mondays,

83
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:34,344
Wednesdays and Fridays, and the other
company only delivers Tuesdays and

84
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:39,130
Thursdays, then the companies can choose
to deliver on the same day to reduce

85
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,780
wait time for customers.

86
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,290
All right, we've come to our final
problem type, finding patterns.

87
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:51,137
Oil and gas companies are constantly
working to keep their machines running

88
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:51,910
properly.

89
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,020
So the problem is,
how to stop machines from breaking down.

90
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,052
One way data analysts can do
this is by looking at patterns

91
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:02,670
in the company's historical data.

92
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,814
For example, they could investigate
how and when a particular machine

93
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:13,580
broke down in the past and then generate
insights into what led to the breakage.

94
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,317
In this case, the company saw pattern
indicating that machines began breaking

95
00:06:19,317 --> 00:06:24,650
down at faster rates when maintenance
wasn't kept up in 15 day cycles.

96
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,811
They can then keep track
of current conditions and

97
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:30,840
intervene if any of these
issues happen again.

98
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,400
Pretty cool, right?

99
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,704
I'm always amazed to hear about
how data helps real people and

100
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:39,380
businesses make meaningful change.

101
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,722
I hope you are too.

102
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:41,222
See you soon.
