1
00:00:00,857 --> 00:00:04,289
Now that we've talked about
six basic problem types,

2
00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:06,458
it's time to start solving them.

3
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:10,282
To do that, data analysts start
by asking the right questions.

4
00:00:10,282 --> 00:00:15,040
In this video, we're going to learn
how to ask effective questions that

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,181
lead to key insights you can use
to solve all kinds of problems.

6
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:22,497
As a data analyst,
I ask questions constantly.

7
00:00:22,497 --> 00:00:24,353
It's a huge part of the job.

8
00:00:24,353 --> 00:00:27,041
If someone requests that
I work on a project,

9
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:31,806
I ask questions to make sure we're on the
same page about the plan and the goals.

10
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:34,574
And when I do get a result, I question it.

11
00:00:34,574 --> 00:00:37,436
Is the data showing me
something superficially?

12
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:40,291
Is there a conflict somewhere
that needs to be resolved?

13
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:44,303
The more questions you ask,
the more you'll learn about your data and

14
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:47,778
the more powerful your insights
will be at the end of the day.

15
00:00:47,778 --> 00:00:50,473
Some questions are more
effective than others.

16
00:00:50,473 --> 00:00:53,197
Let's say you're having
lunch with a friend and

17
00:00:53,197 --> 00:00:56,727
they say, "These are the best
sandwiches ever, aren't they?"

18
00:00:56,727 --> 00:00:59,859
Well, that question doesn't
really give you the opportunity

19
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,218
to share your own opinion,

20
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:05,196
especially if you happen to disagree and
didn't enjoy the sandwich very much.

21
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:09,516
This is called a leading question
because it's leading you to answer in

22
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:10,452
a certain way.

23
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:15,410
Or maybe you're working on a project and
you decide to interview a family member.

24
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,378
Say you ask your uncle,
did you enjoy growing up in Malaysia?

25
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:21,729
He may reply, "Yes."

26
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:24,960
But you haven't learned much
about his experiences there.

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,768
Your question was closed-ended.

28
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:30,887
That means it can be
answered with a yes or no.

29
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:35,602
These kinds of questions rarely
lead to valuable insights.

30
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:40,064
Now what if someone asks you,
do you prefer chocolate or vanilla?

31
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:43,118
Well, what are they
specifically talking about?

32
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,197
Ice cream, pudding,
coffee flavoring or something else?

33
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:50,982
What if you like chocolate ice cream but
vanilla in your coffee?

34
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:53,076
What if you don't like either flavor?

35
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:54,869
That's the problem with this question.

36
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,827
It's too vague and lacks context.

37
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:02,768
Knowing the difference between effective
and ineffective questions is essential for

38
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:04,939
your future career as a data analyst.

39
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:09,947
After all, the data analyst
process starts with the ask phase.

40
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:13,030
So it's important that we
ask the right questions.

41
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,036
Effective questions
follow the SMART methodology.

42
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:24,634
That means they're specific, measurable,
action-oriented, relevant and time-bound.

43
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:26,568
Let's break that down.

44
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:30,313
Specific questions are simple,
significant and

45
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:34,602
focused on a single topic or
a few closely related ideas.

46
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:39,609
This helps us collect information that's
relevant to what we're investigating.

47
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:41,677
If a question is too general,

48
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:45,416
try to narrow it down by
focusing on just one element.

49
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:49,834
For example, instead of asking
a closed-ended question, like,

50
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:53,642
are kids getting enough
physical activities these days?

51
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:57,470
Ask what percentage of kids
achieve the recommended

52
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,911
60 minutes of physical activity
at least five days a week?

53
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:06,919
That question is much more specific and
can give you more useful information.

54
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,512
Now, let's talk about
measurable questions.

55
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:13,823
Measurable questions can be quantified and
assessed.

56
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:19,800
An example of an unmeasurable question
would be, why did a recent video go viral?

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,740
Instead, you could ask how many times
was our video shared on social channels

58
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,648
the first week it was posted?

59
00:03:26,648 --> 00:03:31,502
That question is measurable because
it lets us count the shares and

60
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,198
arrive at a concrete number. Okay,

61
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:36,872
now we've come to
action-oriented questions.

62
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:40,414
Action-oriented questions
encourage change.

63
00:03:40,414 --> 00:03:45,111
You might remember that problem solving
is about seeing the current state and

64
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:48,879
figuring out how to transform
it into the ideal future state.

65
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,326
Well, action-oriented
questions help you get there.

66
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:53,989
So rather than asking,

67
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,159
how can we get customers to
recycle our product packaging?

68
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,903
You could ask, what design features will
make our packaging easier to recycle?

69
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:08,096
This brings you answers you can act on.

70
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:11,249
All right,
let's move on to relevant questions.

71
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:13,026
Relevant questions matter,

72
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:17,651
are important and have significance to
the problem you're trying to solve.

73
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:22,238
Let's say you're working on a problem
related to a threatened species of frog.

74
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:23,291
And you asked,

75
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:28,157
why does it matter that Pine Barrens
tree frogs started disappearing?

76
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:31,340
This is an irrelevant
question because the answer

77
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,669
won't help us find a way to prevent
these frogs from going extinct.

78
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:41,974
A more relevant question would be, what
environmental factors changed in Durham,

79
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:46,593
North Carolina between 1983
and 2004 that could cause

80
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:51,591
Pine Barrens tree frogs to disappear
from the Sandhills Regions?

81
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:56,687
This question would give us answers
we can use to help solve our problem.

82
00:04:56,687 --> 00:05:02,815
That's also a great example for
our final point, time-bound questions.

83
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:06,432
Time-bound questions specify
the time to be studied.

84
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:11,328
The time period we want
to study is 1983 to 2004.

85
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:14,460
This limits the range of possibilities and

86
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,288
enables the data analyst
to focus on relevant data.

87
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:22,640
Okay, now that you have a general
understanding of SMART questions,

88
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,668
there's something else
that's very important

89
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:29,002
to keep in mind when crafting questions,
fairness.

90
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:33,202
We've touched on fairness before,
but as a quick reminder,

91
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:38,634
fairness means ensuring that your
questions don't create or reinforce bias.

92
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:42,755
To talk about this,
let's go back to our sandwich example.

93
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:47,592
There we had an unfair question because it
was phrased to lead you toward a certain

94
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:48,170
answer.

95
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,902
This made it difficult to answer honestly
if you disagreed about the sandwich

96
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:53,571
quality.

97
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:58,074
Another common example of an unfair
question is one that makes assumptions.

98
00:05:58,074 --> 00:05:59,122
For instance,

99
00:05:59,122 --> 00:06:04,529
let's say a satisfaction survey is given
to people who visit a science museum.

100
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,841
If the survey asks,
what do you love most about our exhibits?

101
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:14,178
This assumes that the customer loves
the exhibits which may or may not be true.

102
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:18,755
Fairness also means crafting questions
that make sense to everyone.

103
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:21,591
It's important for
questions to be clear and

104
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:25,930
have a straightforward wording
that anyone can easily understand.

105
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,020
Unfair questions also can make your
job as a data analyst more difficult.

106
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,457
They lead to unreliable feedback and

107
00:06:33,457 --> 00:06:37,555
missed opportunities to gain
some truly valuable insights.

108
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:41,138
You've learned a lot about how
to craft effective questions,

109
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:45,060
like how to use the SMART framework
while creating your questions and

110
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,388
how to ensure that your questions
are fair and objective.

111
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:51,858
Moving forward,
you'll explore different types of data and

112
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:54,805
learn how each is used to
guide business decisions.

113
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:59,464
You'll also learn more about
visualizations and how metrics or

114
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:02,062
measures can help create success.

115
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:03,650
It's going to be great!
