Hi,

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,410
I'm Evan. I'm a learning portfolio
manager here at Google, and

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,140
I have one of the coolest
jobs in the world

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,691
where I get to look at all the different
technologies that affect big data

5
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:17,290
and then work them into training courses
like this one for students to take.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,635
I wish I had a course like this
when I was first coming out of college or

7
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:21,330
high school.

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,630
It was honestly a data analyst course
that's geared in the way like this one is

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,690
if you've already taken
some of the videos

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,230
really prepares you to do
anything you want. It will

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,383
open all of those doors that you want for

12
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:36,130
any of those roles inside
of the data curriculum.

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,560
Well, what are some of those roles?

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,400
There are so many different career paths
for someone who's interested in data.

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,763
Generally, if you're like me,

16
00:00:43,763 --> 00:00:47,230
you'll come in through the door as a data
analyst maybe working with spreadsheets,

17
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,302
maybe working with small,
medium, and large databases,

18
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:53,310
but all you have to remember
is 3 different core roles.

19
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,990
Now there's many in special, whether
specialties, within each of these different

20
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,262
careers, but
these three are the data analysts,

21
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:01,930
which is generally someone who
works with SQL, spreadsheets,

22
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,060
databases, might work as
a business intelligence team

23
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,730
creating those dashboards.

24
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,750
Now where does all that data come from?

25
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,921
Generally, a data analyst will
work with a data engineer to turn

26
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:15,710
that raw data into actionable pipelines.

27
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,731
So you have data analysts,
data engineers, and then lastly,

28
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:22,208
you might have data scientists who
basically say the data engineers have

29
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,920
built these beautiful pipelines.

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,881
Sometimes the analyst do that too.
The analysts have provided us with clean and

31
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:29,540
actionable data. Then the data

32
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,617
scientists then worked actually to turn
it into really cool machine learning

33
00:01:33,617 --> 00:01:36,205
models or
statistical inferences that are just

34
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:39,060
well beyond anything you
could have ever imagined.

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,867
We'll share a lot of resources in links for
ways that you can get excited for

36
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:44,560
each of these different roles.

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,680
And the best part is, if you're like me

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,963
when I went into school, I didn't
know what I wanted to do and

39
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:53,720
you don't have to know at the outset
which path you want to go down.

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,710
Try 'em all.

41
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,310
See what you really, really like.

42
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,120
It's very personal. Becoming
a data analyst is so exciting.

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,073
Why?
Because it's not just like a means to

44
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:03,650
an end.

45
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,468
It's just taking a career path where so
many bright people have gone before and

46
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:13,160
have made the tools and technologies
that much easier for you and me today.

47
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,375
For example, when I was starting
to learn SQL or the structured

48
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:20,076
query language that you're going to
be learning as part of this course,

49
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:24,174
I was doing it on my local laptop and
each of the queries would take like

50
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:26,477
20, 30 minutes to run and
it was very hard for

51
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:29,669
me to keep track of different SQL
statements that I was writing or

52
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:33,060
share them with somebody else. That
was about 10 or 15 years ago.

53
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,311
Now, through all
the different companies and

54
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:38,372
all the different tools that
are making data analysis tools and

55
00:02:38,372 --> 00:02:42,472
technologies easier for you, you're going
to have a blast creating these insights

56
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:45,670
with a lot less of the overhead that
I had when I first started out.

57
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,850
So I'm really excited to
hear what you think and

58
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,550
what your experience is going to be.
