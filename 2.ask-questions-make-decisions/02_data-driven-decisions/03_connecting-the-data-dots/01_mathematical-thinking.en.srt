1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,956
So far, you've learned a lot about
how to think like a data analyst.

2
00:00:04,956 --> 00:00:07,550
We've explored a few
different ways of thinking.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:12,242
And now, I want to take that one step
further by using a mathematical approach

4
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:14,130
to problem-solving.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,240
Mathematical thinking is a powerful skill
you can use to help you solve problems and

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,340
see new solutions.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,569
So, let's take some time to talk about
what mathematical thinking is, and

8
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:27,170
how you can start using it.

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,900
Using a mathematical approach doesn't mean
you have to suddenly become a math whiz.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,660
It means looking at a problem and
logically breaking it down step-by-step,

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,334
so you can see the relationship
of patterns in your data, and

12
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:43,410
use that to analyze your problem.

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,799
This kind of thinking can also help you
figure out the best tools for analysis

14
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,124
because it lets us see the different
aspects of a problem and

15
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:53,740
choose the best logical approach.

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,790
There are a lot of factors to consider
when choosing the most helpful tool for

17
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,410
your analysis.

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,040
One way you could decide which tool to
use is by the size of your dataset.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,040
When working with data, you'll find
that there's big and small data.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,550
Small data can be really small.

21
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,064
These kinds of data tend to be made up
of datasets concerned with specific

22
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:18,850
metrics over a short,
well defined period of time.

23
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,070
Like how much water you drink in a day.

24
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,268
Small data can be useful for
making day-to-day decisions,

25
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:26,700
like deciding to drink more water.

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,737
But it doesn't have a huge impact
on bigger frameworks like business

27
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:32,470
operations.

28
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,632
You might use spreadsheets to organize and

29
00:01:34,632 --> 00:01:37,000
analyze smaller datasets
when you first start out.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,299
Big data on the other hand has larger,

31
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:44,000
less specific datasets covering
a longer period of time.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,690
They usually have to be
broken down to be analyzed.

33
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:53,000
Big data is useful for looking at large-
scale questions and problems, and

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,900
they help companies make big decisions.

35
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,400
When you're working with data on this
larger scale, you might switch to SQL.

36
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,889
Let's look at an example of how a data
analyst working in a hospital might use

37
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:09,360
mathematical thinking to solve
a problem with the right tools.

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,974
The hospital might find that they're
having a problem with over or

39
00:02:12,974 --> 00:02:14,890
under use of their beds.

40
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,750
Based on that, the hospital could
make bed optimization a goal.

41
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,183
They want to make sure that beds are
available to patients who need them, but

42
00:02:24,183 --> 00:02:29,550
not waste hospital resources like space or
money on maintaining empty beds.

43
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,489
Using mathematical thinking, you can break
this problem down into a step-by-step

44
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,300
process to help you find
patterns in their data.

45
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,600
There's a lot of variables
in this scenario.

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,360
But for now, let's keep it simple and
focus on just a few key ones.

47
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,500
There are metrics that are related to this
problem that might show us patterns in

48
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,190
the data:

49
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,500
for example,
maybe the number of beds open and

50
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,280
the number of beds used
over a period of time.

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,000
There's actually already a formula for
this.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,362
It's called the bed occupancy rate, and

53
00:03:02,362 --> 00:03:06,333
it's calculated using the total
number of inpatient days, and

54
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:10,200
the total number of available
beds over a given period of time.

55
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,704
What we want to do now is take our key
variables and see how their relationship

56
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:19,500
to each other might show us patterns that
can help the hospital make a decision.

57
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,740
To do that, we have to choose the tool
that makes sense for this task.

58
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,040
Hospitals generate a lot of patient
data over a long period of time.

59
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,150
So logically, a tool that's capable
of handling big datasets is a must.

60
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,480
SQL is a great choice.

61
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,900
In this case, you discover that
the hospital always has unused beds.

62
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,526
Knowing that, they can choose to get rid
of some beds, which saves them space and

63
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:50,796
money that they can use to buy and
store protective equipment.

64
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:53,860
By considering all of the individual
parts of this problem logically,

65
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,700
mathematical thinking helped us see new
perspectives that led us to a solution.

66
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,000
Well, that's it for now.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,110
Great job.

68
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,780
You've covered a lot of material already.

69
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,898
You've learned about how empowering
data can be in decision-making,

70
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:12,190
the difference between quantitative and
qualitative analysis,

71
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,000
using reports and dashboards for
data visualization,

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,820
metrics, and using a mathematical
approach to problem-solving.

73
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,150
Coming up next,
we'll be tackling spreadsheet basics.

74
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,972
You'll get to put what you've
learned into action and

75
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:30,460
learn a new tool to help you
along the data analysis process.

76
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,040
See you soon.
