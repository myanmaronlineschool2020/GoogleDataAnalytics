1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,150
We've talked a lot
about what data

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,955
is and how it plays
into decision-making.

3
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:07,740
What do we know already?

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,130
Well, we know that data
is a collection of facts.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,620
We also know that
data analysis reveals

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,755
important patterns and
insights about that data.

7
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:19,259
Finally, we know
that data analysis

8
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:21,810
can help us make more
informed decisions.

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,150
Now, we'll look at
how data plays into

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,970
the decision-making
process and take

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,860
a quick look at the
differences between

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,145
data-driven and
data-inspired decisions.

13
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:34,575
Let's look at a
real-life example.

14
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:36,300
Think about the last time you

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,810
searched "restaurants
near me" and

16
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,580
sorted the results by rating to

17
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,085
help you decide which
one looks best.

18
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:46,255
That was a decision
you made using data.

19
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,920
Businesses and other
organizations use data

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,470
to make better
decisions all the time.

21
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,330
There's two ways
they can do this,

22
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,885
with data-driven or
data-inspired decision-making.

23
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:58,430
We'll talk more about

24
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,830
data-inspired
decision-making later on,

25
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,085
but here's a quick
definition for now.

26
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:05,435
Data-inspired decision-making

27
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:07,400
explores different data sources

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,620
to find out what
they have in common.

29
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,250
Here at Google, we use
data every single day,

30
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,365
in very surprising ways too.

31
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:18,320
For example, we use data
to help cut back on

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,215
the amount of energy spent
cooling your data centers.

33
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,630
After analyzing years of

34
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,150
data collected with
artificial intelligence,

35
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,890
we were able to make decisions

36
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,690
that help reduce the energy we

37
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,770
use to cool our data
centers by over 40 percent.

38
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,230
Google's People Operations team

39
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,000
also uses data to improve how

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,545
we hire new Googlers

41
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:42,380
and how we get them
started on the right foot.

42
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,420
We wanted to make sure we weren't

43
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,060
passing over any
talented applicants and

44
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,830
that we made their
transition into

45
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,965
their new roles as
smooth as possible.

46
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:56,165
After analyzing data on
applications, interviews,

47
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:58,625
and new hire
orientation processes,

48
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,815
we started using an algorithm.

49
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:03,470
An algorithm is a
process or set of

50
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,350
rules to be followed
for a specific task.

51
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,650
With this algorithm, we
reviewed applicants that didn't

52
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,390
pass the initial
screening process

53
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,235
to find great candidates.

54
00:02:13,235 --> 00:02:15,725
Data also helped us determine

55
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:17,780
the ideal number of
interviews that lead to

56
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,850
the best possible
hiring decisions.

57
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,640
We've created new
onboarding agendas to

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,745
help new employees get
started at their new jobs.

59
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,145
Data is everywhere.

60
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:31,880
Today, we create so much data
that scientists estimate

61
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,950
90 percent of the world's data

62
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,600
has been created in just
the last few years.

63
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,440
Think of the potential here.

64
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,045
The more data we have,

65
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:42,160
the bigger the problems
we can solve and

66
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,875
the more powerful our
solutions can be.

67
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,885
But responsibly gathering data

68
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:48,775
is only part of the process.

69
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:50,740
We also have to turn data into

70
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,545
knowledge that helps us
make better solutions.

71
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:55,300
I'm going to let fellow Googler,

72
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,295
Ed, talk more about that.

73
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:59,755
Just having tons of
data isn't enough.

74
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:02,080
We have to do something
meaningful with it.

75
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,495
Data in itself
provides little value.

76
00:03:04,495 --> 00:03:06,220
To quote Jack Dorsey,

77
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,080
the founder of
Twitter and Square,

78
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,090
"Every single action
that we do in

79
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,505
this world is triggering
off some amount of data,

80
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:15,640
and most of that data is
meaningless until someone adds

81
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,290
some interpretation of it

82
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,355
or someone adds a
narrative around it."

83
00:03:19,355 --> 00:03:22,515
Data is straightforward,
facts collected together,

84
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:24,620
values that describe something.

85
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,810
Individual data
points become more

86
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,820
useful when they're
collected and structured,

87
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,880
but they're still somewhat
meaningless by themselves.

88
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,510
We need to interpret data to
turn it into information.

89
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,290
Look at Michael Phelps' time in

90
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,885
a 200-meter individual
medal swimming race,

91
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:42,165
one minute, 54 seconds.

92
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:44,210
Doesn't tell us much. When we

93
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,400
compare it to his competitor's
times in the race,

94
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,560
however, we can see
that Michael came

95
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,205
in the first place and
won the gold medal.

96
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:53,735
Our analysis took
data, in this case,

97
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:56,600
a list of Michael's races
and times and turned it into

98
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,780
information by comparing
it with other data.

99
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,430
Context is important.

100
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,940
We needed to know that this
race was an Olympic final and

101
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,950
not some other random race to

102
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,115
determine that this was
a gold medal finish.

103
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:12,620
But this still isn't knowledge.

104
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,170
When we consume
information, understand it,

105
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,245
and apply it, that's when
data is most useful.

106
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:21,665
In other words, Michael
Phelps is a fast swimmer.

107
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:24,830
It's pretty cool how
we can turn data into

108
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,635
knowledge that helps us
in all kinds of ways,

109
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,900
whether it's finding the
perfect restaurant or

110
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,470
making environmentally
friendly changes.

111
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,905
But keep in mind,

112
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:36,500
there are limitations
to data analytics.

113
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,060
Sometimes we don't have

114
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,195
access to all of
the data we need,

115
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:43,565
or data is measured
differently across programs,

116
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:46,745
which can make it difficult
to find concrete examples.

117
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,310
We'll cover these more
in detail later on,

118
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,630
but it's important that you start

119
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,160
thinking about them now.

120
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,390
Now that you know how data
drives decision-making,

121
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,080
you know how key your role as

122
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,239
a data analyst is
to the business.

123
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:02,195
Data is a powerful tool
for decision-making,

124
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:05,840
and you can help provide
businesses with the information

125
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,670
they need to solve problems
and make new decisions,

126
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,420
but before that, you will

127
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,070
need to learn a little more about

128
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,480
the kinds of data you'll be

129
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,580
working with and how
to deal with it.
