00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,510
Welcome back. Now it's time to

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,760
go even further and
build on what you've

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,410
learned about problem-solving in

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,890
data analytics and crafting
effective questions.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,800
Coming up, we'll cover
a wide range of topics.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,870
You'll learn about
how data can empower

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,140
our decisions, big and small;

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,580
the difference between

9
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,355
quantitative and
qualitative analysis

10
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,020
and when to use them;

11
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,415
the pros and cons of different
data visualization tools;

12
00:00:28,415 --> 00:00:31,775
what metrics are, and
how analysts use them;

13
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:35,855
and how to use mathematical
thinking to connect the dots.

14
00:00:35,855 --> 00:00:37,850
To be honest, I'm still learning

15
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,830
more about these
things every day,

16
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,960
and so will you! Like how

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,155
quantitative and qualitative
data can work together.

18
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:46,925
In my role in finance,

19
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:49,250
most of my work is quantitative,

20
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,280
but recently I was working
on a project that focused

21
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,140
a lot on empathy and trust

22
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,330
and that was really new for me.

23
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,910
But we took those more
qualitative things

24
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,549
into account during analysis,

25
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:03,140
and that really helped
me understand how

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,750
quantitative and
qualitative data can come

27
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,665
together to help us make
powerful decisions.

28
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:11,930
Now you're on your
way to building

29
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,125
your own data analyst toolkit.

30
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,545
Before you know it,

31
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:17,810
you'll be analyzing
all kinds of data

32
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,720
yourself and learning new
things while you do it.

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,460
But first, let's start

34
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,710
small with the power
of observation.
