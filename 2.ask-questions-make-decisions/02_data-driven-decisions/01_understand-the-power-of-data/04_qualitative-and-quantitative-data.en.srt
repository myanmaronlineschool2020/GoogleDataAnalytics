00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Hi again.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,180
When it comes to
decision-making, data is key.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,650
But we've also learned that

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,000
there are a lot of
different kinds

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,670
of questions that data
might help us answer,

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,334
and these different questions

7
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:15,390
make different kinds of data.

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,940
There are two kinds of data
that we'll talk about in

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,385
this video, quantitative
and qualitative.

10
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:23,970
Quantitative data is all about

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,870
the specific and objective
measures of numerical facts.

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,465
This can often be the what,

13
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:35,385
how many, and how
often about a problem.

14
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:38,250
In other words, things
you can measure,

15
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,710
like how many commuters

16
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,735
take the train to
work every week.

17
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:43,505
As a financial analyst,

18
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:46,400
I work with a lot
of quantitative data.

19
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,110
I love the certainty
and accuracy of numbers.

20
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,675
On the other hand,

21
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:53,810
qualitative data describes

22
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,720
subjective or
explanatory measures of

23
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,360
qualities and characteristics or

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,495
things that can't be measured
with numerical data,

25
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,145
like your hair color.

26
00:01:04,145 --> 00:01:06,650
Qualitative data is great

27
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,245
for helping us answer
why questions.

28
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:12,050
For example, why
people might like

29
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,170
a certain celebrity or snack
food more than others.

30
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,840
With quantitative data,
we can see numbers

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,585
visualized as charts or graphs.

32
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:22,910
Qualitative data can then give us

33
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,920
a more high-level
understanding of

34
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,185
why the numbers are
the way they are.

35
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:29,510
This is important
because it helps

36
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,925
us add context to a problem.

37
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,425
As a data analyst,

38
00:01:33,425 --> 00:01:34,790
you'll be using both

39
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,685
quantitative and
qualitative analysis,

40
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:39,965
depending on your business task.

41
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:42,860
Reviews are a great
example of this.

42
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,170
Think about a time you
used reviews to decide

43
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,200
whether you wanted to buy
something or go somewhere.

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,570
These reviews might have told you

45
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,110
how many people dislike
that thing and why.

46
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,600
Businesses read
these reviews too,

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,300
but they use the data
in different ways.

48
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,900
Let's look at an example of
a business using data from

49
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,550
customer reviews to see

50
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,390
qualitative and quantitative
data in action.

51
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,720
Now, say a local ice cream
shop has started using

52
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,490
their online reviews
to engage with

53
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,040
their customers and
build their brand.

54
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,545
These reviews give
the ice cream shop

55
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:21,680
insights into their
customers' experiences,

56
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,190
which they can use to inform
their decision-making.

57
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,880
The owner notices that their
rating has been going down.

58
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,710
He sees that lately his shop

59
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,140
has been receiving
more negative reviews.

60
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,950
He wants to know why,

61
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,565
so he starts asking questions.

62
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:40,220
First are measurable questions.

63
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,820
How many negative
reviews are there?

64
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,950
What's the average rating?

65
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,030
How many of these reviews
use the same keywords?

66
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,570
These questions generate
quantitative data,

67
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,740
numerical results that help

68
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,920
confirm their customers
aren't satisfied.

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,580
This data might lead them
to ask different questions.

70
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,245
Why are customers
unsatisfied?

71
00:03:04,245 --> 00:03:07,345
How can we improve
their experience?

72
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:10,955
These are questions that
lead to qualitative data.

73
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:12,920
After looking
through the reviews,

74
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,540
the ice cream shop
owner sees a pattern,

75
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,790
17 of negative reviews use

76
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,890
the word "frustrated."
That's quantitative data.

77
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,010
Now we can start collecting
qualitative data

78
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,420
by asking why this word
is being repeated?

79
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,290
He finds that customers are

80
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,060
frustrated because the shop is

81
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,675
running out of popular flavors
before the end of the day.

82
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:39,320
Knowing this, the ice
cream shop can change its

83
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,000
weekly order to
make sure it has

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,450
enough of what the
customers want.

85
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,345
With both quantitative
and qualitative data,

86
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:50,450
the ice cream shop owner
was able to figure out

87
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,445
his customers were unhappy
and understand why.

88
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:57,620
Having both types of data
made it possible for

89
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,880
him to make the right changes
and improve his business.

90
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,340
Now that you know the
difference between

91
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,935
quantitative and
qualitative data,

92
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:08,930
you know how to get
different types of

93
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,315
data by asking
different questions.

94
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:14,240
It's your job as a data
detective to know

95
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,980
which questions to ask to
find the right solution.

96
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,730
Then you can start thinking

97
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,560
about cool and creative ways to

98
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,130
help stakeholders better
understand the data.

99
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,800
For example,
interactive dashboards,

100
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,120
which we'll learn about soon.
