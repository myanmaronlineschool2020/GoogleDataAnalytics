00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:05,988
In the last video, we learned how you can
visualize your data using reports and

2
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:10,110
dashboards to show off your
findings in interesting ways.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,503
In one of our examples,

4
00:00:11,503 --> 00:00:15,890
the company wanted to see the sales
revenue of each salesperson.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,230
That specific measurement of
data is done using metrics.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,623
Now, I want to tell you a little bit more
about the difference between data and

7
00:00:24,623 --> 00:00:25,530
metrics.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,480
And how metrics can be used to
turn data into useful information.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:37,700
A metric is a single, quantifiable type
of data that can be used for measurement.

10
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,220
Think of it this way.

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,050
Data starts as a collection of raw facts,
until we organize

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,430
them into individual metrics that
represent a single type of data.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,540
Metrics can also be combined
into formulas that you can plug

14
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,435
your numerical data into.

15
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:59,192
In our earlier sales revenue example
all that data doesn't mean much

16
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:03,650
unless we use a specific
metric to organize it.

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,570
So let's use revenue by individual
salesperson as our metric.

18
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,193
Now we can see whose sales
brought in the highest revenue.

19
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:15,610
Metrics usually involve simple math.

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:22,090
Revenue, for example, is the number of
sales multiplied by the sales price.

21
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,400
Choosing the right metric is key.

22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,540
Data contains a lot of raw details
about the problem we're exploring.

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,860
But we need the right metrics
to get the answers we're looking for.

24
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,550
Different industries will use all kinds of
metrics to measure things in a data set.

25
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:46,140
Let's look at some more ways businesses
in different industries use metrics.

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,620
So you can see how you might apply
metrics to your collected data.

27
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,010
Ever heard of ROI?

28
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,130
Companies use this metric all the time.

29
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,351
ROI, or Return on Investment is
essentially a formula designed using

30
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:06,900
metrics that let a business know
how well an investment is doing.

31
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,315
The ROI is made up of two metrics,

32
00:02:09,315 --> 00:02:13,902
the net profit over a period of time and
the cost of investment.

33
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:19,255
By comparing these two metrics, profit and
cost of investment, the company

34
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:25,150
can analyze the data they have to see
how well their investment is doing.

35
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,900
This can then help them decide
how to invest in the future and

36
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,130
which investments to prioritize.

37
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,565
We see metrics used in marketing too.

38
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:39,620
For example, metrics can be used to
help calculate customer retention rates,

39
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,140
or a company's ability to
keep its customers over time.

40
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,862
Customer retention rates can help the
company compare the number of customers at

41
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:53,510
the beginning and the end of a period
to see their retention rates.

42
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,270
This way the company knows how successful
their marketing strategies are

43
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,667
and if they need to research new
approaches to bring back more repeat

44
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:02,330
customers.

45
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,065
Different industries use all
kinds of different metrics.

46
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:09,693
But there's one thing
they all have in common:

47
00:03:09,693 --> 00:03:13,185
they're all trying to meet
a specific goal by measuring data.

48
00:03:14,385 --> 00:03:20,915
This metric goal is a measurable goal set
by a company and evaluated using metrics.

49
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:23,369
And just like there are a lot
of possible metrics,

50
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,245
there are lots of possible goals too.

51
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,250
Maybe an organization wants to meet
a certain number of monthly sales,

52
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,160
or maybe a certain percentage
of repeat customers.

53
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,276
By using metrics to focus on
individual aspects of your data,

54
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:42,440
you can start to see the story
your data is telling.

55
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,090
Metric goals and formulas are great
ways to measure and understand data.

56
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,060
But they're not the only ways.

57
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,920
We'll talk more about how to interpret and
understand data throughout this course.
