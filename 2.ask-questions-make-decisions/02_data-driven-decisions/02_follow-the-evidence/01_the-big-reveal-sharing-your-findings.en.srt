1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,540
Data is great, but if we

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,225
can't communicate the
story data is telling,

3
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:08,160
it isn't useful to anyone.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,440
We need ways to
organize data that

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,885
help us turn it
into information.

6
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:15,780
There are all kinds of tools
out there to help you

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,920
visualize and share

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,350
your data analysis
with stakeholders.

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,970
Here, we'll talk about

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,935
two data presentation tools,
reports and dashboards.

11
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:27,750
Reports and dashboards are both

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,790
useful for data visualization.

13
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,250
But there are pros and
cons for each of them.

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,680
A report is a static
collection of

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,590
data given to stakeholders
periodically.

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,435
A dashboard on the other hand,

17
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:42,135
monitors live, incoming data.

18
00:00:42,135 --> 00:00:44,265
Let's talk about reports first.

19
00:00:44,265 --> 00:00:46,650
Reports are great for
giving snapshots of

20
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,860
high level historical
data for an organization.

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,520
For example, a finance
firm's monthly sales.

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,205
Reports come with a
lot of benefits too.

23
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:59,100
They can be designed and
sent out periodically,

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,725
often on a weekly
or monthly basis,

25
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:05,130
as organized and easy to
reference information.

26
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,350
They're quick to
design and easy to

27
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,590
use as long as you
continually maintain them.

28
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,710
Finally, because reports
use static data or

29
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,680
data that doesn't change
once it's been recorded,

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,530
they reflect data that's already
been cleaned and sorted.

31
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,450
There are some downsides
to keep in mind too.

32
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,775
Reports need regular maintenance

33
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:28,225
and aren't very
visually appealing.

34
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:30,995
Because they aren't
automatic or dynamic,

35
00:01:30,995 --> 00:01:34,055
reports don't show
live, evolving data.

36
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:36,665
For a live reflection
of incoming data,

37
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:38,710
you'll want to
design a dashboard.

38
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,240
Dashboards are great
for a lot of reasons,

39
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,830
they give your team more access

40
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,885
to information being recorded,

41
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:48,380
you can interact through data
by playing with filters,

42
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,105
and because they're dynamic,

43
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:52,375
they have long-term value.

44
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:56,045
If stakeholders need to
continually access information,

45
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:57,920
a dashboard can be
more efficient than

46
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,020
having to pull reports
over and over,

47
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,665
which is a big time
saver for you.

48
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,280
Last but not least,

49
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,930
they're just nice to look at.

50
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,675
But dashboards do
have some cons too.

51
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:11,480
For one thing, they take a
lot of time to design and

52
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,480
can actually be less
efficient than reports,

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,370
if they're not used very often.

54
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,250
If the base table
breaks at any point,

55
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,930
they need a lot of maintenance to

56
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,795
get back up and running again.

57
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:25,010
Dashboards can
sometimes overwhelm

58
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,960
people with information too.

59
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,310
If you aren't used to

60
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,125
looking through data
on a dashboard,

61
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,880
you might get lost in it.

62
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,500
As a data analyst,

63
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,090
you need to decide
the best way to

64
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,670
communicate information
to your stakeholders.

65
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,460
For example, what if your
stakeholders are

66
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,660
interested in the company's
social media engagement?

67
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,830
Would a monthly report
that tells them

68
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,830
the number of new followers
for their page be useful?

69
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,960
Or a dashboard that monitors live

70
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,070
social media engagement
across multiple platforms?

71
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,550
Later on, you'll create

72
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,660
your own reports and

73
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,885
dashboards to practice
using these tools.

74
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:00,920
But for now, I want
to show you what

75
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,170
a report and a dashboard
might look like.

76
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,880
We'll start by using a tool we're

77
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,085
already familiar
with, spreadsheets.

78
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:08,300
Let's see one way

79
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,065
spreadsheet data could be
visualized in a report.

80
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,085
This spreadsheet
has a data set with

81
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:15,850
order details from a
wholesale company.

82
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,745
That's a lot of information.

83
00:03:17,745 --> 00:03:19,160
From the headers, we can see

84
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,855
different things recorded here,

85
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:22,220
like the order date,

86
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,545
the salesperson, the unit price,

87
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:27,265
and revenue for each
transaction recorded.

88
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:29,675
It's all useful information,

89
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:31,910
but a little hard to
wrap your head around.

90
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,570
We want a report
that's easier to read.

91
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,230
Let's say your stakeholders want

92
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,020
a quick look at the
revenue by salesperson.

93
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,540
Using the data, you
could make them a pivot

94
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,815
table with a graph that
shows that information.

95
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:46,130
A pivot table is

96
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,720
a data summarization tool

97
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,655
that is used in data processing.

98
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:53,855
Pivot tables are used to
summarize, sort, re-organize,

99
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:56,135
group, count, total,

100
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,610
or average data
stored in a database.

101
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,830
It allows its users to transform

102
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,905
columns into rows and
rows into columns.

103
00:04:03,905 --> 00:04:06,665
We'll actually learn more
about pivot tables later.

104
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:08,470
But I'll show you
one really quick.

105
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,545
We'll select the Data menu
and click Pivot table button.

106
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,675
It can pull data from this table.

107
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:15,890
We can just press

108
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,290
create and it'll pull
up a new worksheet.

109
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,730
Over here, it gives us

110
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,835
the pivot table fields
we can choose from.

111
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:26,620
Click select, salesperson
and revenue.

112
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,260
Just like that, it
made a chart for us.

113
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,700
At this point, you can

114
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,575
play around with how
the graph looks,

115
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:36,525
but the information is all there.

116
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:38,130
Let's move on to dashboards.

117
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,860
If you need a more dynamic way to

118
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,960
share information with
your stakeholders,

119
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,370
dashboards are your friend.

120
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,325
You might create something
like this Tableau dashboard.

121
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:48,260
With interactive graphs that

122
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,450
showcase multiple
views of the data.

123
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,410
With this, users can change
location, date range,

124
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,960
or any other aspect of
the data they're viewing

125
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,885
by clicking through different
elements on the dashboard.

126
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:01,300
Pretty cool, right?

127
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,780
Later in this program,

128
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,310
we'll look into how you can make

129
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,370
your own data visualizations.

130
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,780
We have a lot to learn
before we get to that.

131
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,420
But I hope this was an
exciting first peek at

132
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,220
the different visualization tools

133
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,380
you'll be using as
a data analyst.
