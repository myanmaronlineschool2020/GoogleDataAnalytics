00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,564
Data analysts spend a lot of time
organizing data and performing

2
00:00:05,564 --> 00:00:06,740
calculations.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,106
Luckily, there's lots of different
tools to help them do just that,

4
00:00:11,106 --> 00:00:15,842
including spreadsheets. In this video we'll
take a look at some of the ways data

5
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:21,180
analysts use spreadsheets to help them
with their day to day responsibilities.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,579
Later, you'll get to test out some of
these things yourself, but for now,

7
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:29,774
let's start with a quick look at how
data analysts use spreadsheets to do

8
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:30,560
their jobs.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,670
This will change depending on
the work you need to complete.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,740
But here's an overview of
a few of the major tasks.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,270
Imagine you work for a construction company.

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,427
Your company needs your spreadsheet skills
to analyze some data about their expenses,

13
00:00:44,427 --> 00:00:48,340
so you access the appropriate data and
add it to your spreadsheet.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,936
We won't cover all the details
of this project right now, but

15
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:55,878
you will get a chance to see lots of
spreadsheet features up close and

16
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:57,630
personal as we move forward.

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,310
What do you do with the data now
that it's in your spreadsheet? Again,

18
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,666
this will be different for each job, but

19
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:07,980
you might start by organizing your
data with the task you've been given.

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,160
For example,
you might put your data in a pivot table.

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,099
We've talked about pivot tables
before in this course. We'll cover

22
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:19,035
them in more detail later on, but
for now, just think of them as

23
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:21,480
well organized and very useful tables.

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,956
Next, you might filter
the data in the pivot table.

25
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:28,750
Sorting and filtering data is
a common part of most jobs.

26
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,170
This lets you focus only on the data
you'll need for your analysis.

27
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,002
In our example, maybe you only need
the expenses for a certain time frame,

28
00:01:38,002 --> 00:01:41,700
like the last three months.
After you filtered your data,

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,010
you could perform some calculations
to learn more about it.

30
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,997
Maybe you need to find out which
construction projects ended up costing

31
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:51,170
the most money.

32
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,480
This is where formulas and
functions are really handy.

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,772
We'll talk about them in just a bit, but
formulas and functions are great for

34
00:01:59,772 --> 00:02:05,580
doing some quick math, especially once you
run out of fingers and toes to count on.

35
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,278
Now you've seen some of the ways data
analysts are using spreadsheets in their

36
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:12,909
day to day work for
a lot of different tasks,

37
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:17,679
including organizing their data and making
calculations. Before you know it we'll

38
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,330
have you working in your own spreadsheets.
