00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,210
Hi, again. I'm glad you're back.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,665
In this part of the program,

3
00:00:04,665 --> 00:00:06,690
we'll revisit the spreadsheet.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,245
Spreadsheets are a powerful
and versatile tool,

5
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:12,060
which is why they're
a big part of

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,820
pretty much everything
we do as data analysts.

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,200
There's a good chance a

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,300
spreadsheet will
be the first tool

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,890
you reach for when trying

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,110
to answer data-driven questions.

11
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,590
After you've defined what you
need to do with the data,

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,570
you'll turn to
spreadsheets to help

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,150
build evidence that you
can then visualize,

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,190
and use to support your findings.

15
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,840
Spreadsheets are often

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,400
the unsung heroes
of the data world.

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,380
They don't always get the
appreciation they deserve,

18
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,044
but as a data detective,

19
00:00:41,044 --> 00:00:42,440
you'll definitely want them in

20
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,085
your evidence collection kit.

21
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,800
I know spreadsheets have saved

22
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,780
the day for me more than once.

23
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,855
I've added data for purchase
orders into a sheet,

24
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:52,955
setup formulas in one tab,

25
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:54,770
and had the same formulas do

26
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,810
the work for me in other tabs.

27
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,670
This frees up time for me to work

28
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,575
on other things during the day.

29
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:03,395
I couldn't imagine not
using spreadsheets.

30
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:07,115
Math is a core part of
every data analyst's job,

31
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:09,495
but not every analyst enjoys it.

32
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:11,480
Luckily, spreadsheets can make

33
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,610
calculations more enjoyable,

34
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,755
and by that, I mean
easier. Let's see how.

35
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:19,370
Spreadsheets can do

36
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,000
both basic and complex
calculations automatically.

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,045
Not only does this help you
work more efficiently,

38
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,260
but it also lets you see

39
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,515
the results and understand
how you got them.

40
00:01:29,515 --> 00:01:31,370
Here's a quick look at some of

41
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,600
the functions that you'll

42
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,850
use when performing calculations.

43
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,920
Many functions can be used as

44
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,415
part of a math formula as well.

45
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:43,085
Functions and formulas
also have other uses,

46
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:44,840
and we'll take a
look at those too.

47
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,330
We'll take things one
step further with

48
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,965
exercises that use real
data from databases.

49
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:54,515
This is your chance to
reorganize a spreadsheet,

50
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,420
do some actual data analysis,

51
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,950
and have some fun with data.
