1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,660
We've talked about how
spreadsheets are great

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,480
for organizing data and
performing calculations.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,370
Now, it's time to get our hands

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,205
dirty and start building
a real spreadsheet.

5
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:14,715
In this video, I'm going to
demonstrate some basic tasks

6
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,040
we know data analysts
use spreadsheets

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,050
for, including entering
and organizing data.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,490
We'll start with a
step-by-step process to show

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,790
you some tools to organize
your data in a spreadsheet.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,370
Consider these steps the basics.

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,020
You won't always have to use

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,759
them when working with a data set,

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,685
but if your data is a bit
messy when you get it,

14
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:38,760
these steps can help you
get it ready for analysis.

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,475
Let's start by opening
a new spreadsheet.

16
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:42,800
As a data analyst,

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,945
you might not start with
a blank spreadsheet,

18
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:47,930
but it's good to know how
to do it, just in case.

19
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,930
Start by opening Excel,

20
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,260
Google Sheets or whatever

21
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,165
spreadsheet software
you're using,

22
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:55,925
then select a new blank file.

23
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:57,890
The first thing you'll
want to do when you open

24
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,190
a new spreadsheet is give it
a title. Here's a pro tip.

25
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,110
Make your title short, clear,

26
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,550
and have it state exactly what

27
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,560
the data in the
spreadsheet is about.

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,105
Trust me, it'll make searching
for it a lot easier.

29
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:13,070
Creating a folder on your
computer specifically for

30
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,660
spreadsheets and related files

31
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,660
can also make it
easier to find them.

32
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,930
For this spreadsheet, it's
already saved in our drive.

33
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,210
So we'll open our File
menu to click Move.

34
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,400
Then we'll create a new folder,

35
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,050
name it "Population Data,"

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,030
and move the spreadsheet there.

37
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,400
Our spreadsheet now
has a new home.

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,970
This will save you a lot of

39
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,560
unnecessary clicks and headaches

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,105
when you look for this file.

41
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:51,340
There's a few different
ways data analysts

42
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,780
get data they work with.

43
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,965
Depending on the job,

44
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:56,230
you might use data
from an open source,

45
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,150
you might be given
data to work with

46
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,610
or you might be asked
to find your own data.

47
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,640
You'll experience all of
these later in the program.

48
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,320
There's a lot of open
data sources online,

49
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,675
where data is made
available to the public.

50
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:12,620
For example, we'll use
data from worldbank.org,

51
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,350
that's already in
the spreadsheet.

52
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,370
The data shows the population of

53
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,810
Latin American and Caribbean
countries from 2010-2019.

54
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,160
Let's open this spreadsheet.

55
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,155
Time to get the data
ready for analysis.

56
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:30,530
We'll start by selecting
the whole sheet and

57
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,030
making our columns wider by

58
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,400
dragging the boundary
of one of the columns.

59
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,425
This will help us see
the data clearly,

60
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:41,600
then we can adjust

61
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,715
any individual columns
that need it.

62
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:46,610
You can make columns wider
in other ways as well,

63
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,325
but this will work for now.

64
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:50,930
The first row of the
spreadsheet is for

65
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,445
data attributes or variables.

66
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:57,125
It's basically labeling the
type of data in each column.

67
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,050
Let's make the attributes
stand out from the rest of

68
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,715
the rows by selecting it
and filling it with color.

69
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:07,600
We'll also make the labels bold.

70
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,000
If we want to add
another data attribute

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,489
between two of the
other attributes,

72
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,865
we can always add a new column.

73
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,880
Just click on any cell within

74
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,990
a column and use the Insert
menu to add a new one.

75
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,270
It will appear next
to the column you

76
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,825
originally clicked,
pretty simple.

77
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:37,620
Deleting a column
is just as simple.

78
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,770
To delete, right-click in

79
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,170
a cell in the column
you want to get rid of.

80
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,580
The steps we're showing
may be different

81
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,815
depending on the spreadsheet
program you're using,

82
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:50,525
but should be pretty similar.

83
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:53,790
Let's add one more thing to
our data table: borders.

84
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,990
This can help you see each
piece of data more clearly.

85
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,780
To add borders start by
clicking the Select

86
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,215
All button at the top left
corner of your spreadsheet.

87
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:06,710
This is like a magic button
because you can click it

88
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,090
whenever you need to make

89
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,400
changes to every cell
in your spreadsheet.

90
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,410
Then click the Border button in

91
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,430
the menu, and choose the
type of borders you want.

92
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,730
To keep our spreadsheets uniform,

93
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,680
we'll choose borders
for all cells.

94
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,850
Just like that, we've
gone from raw to refined.

95
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,900
Now our spreadsheet
is filled with

96
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,460
data and it's nice
to look at too.

97
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,540
Using these organization
tools before you analyze can

98
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,305
help you focus on the data
once you start your analysis.

99
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:38,315
Now that we've gone
over some ways

100
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:40,640
spreadsheets can be
used to organize data,

101
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,520
you're ready to start
working on them yourself.

102
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,055
Later you'll learn more
about spreadsheets,

103
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:50,099
including some common
errors and how to fix them.
