1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,020
Earlier I told you that carefully

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,925
defining a business problem can

3
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:09,990
ultimately save time,
money, and resources.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,685
All of this is achieved
through structured thinking.

5
00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:15,960
Structured thinking
is the process of

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,455
recognizing the current
problem or situation,

7
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:22,200
organizing available information,

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,990
revealing gaps and opportunities,

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,555
and identifying the options.

10
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:31,140
In other words, it's a way
of being super prepared.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,270
It's having a clear list of what

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,190
you are expected to deliver,

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,395
a timeline for major
tasks and activities,

14
00:00:38,395 --> 00:00:42,670
and checkpoints so the team
knows you're making progress.

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,690
In this video, we'll look at

16
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,885
how structured thinking helps
us save time and effort,

17
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:51,005
but also makes our job
as data analysts easier

18
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:52,550
because it allows us to better

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,670
understand the work we are doing.

20
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,105
In the business world,

21
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:58,460
it's common for teams
to spend hours of

22
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,045
valuable time trying to
solve an important problem,

23
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:04,870
only to end up back
where they started.

24
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,030
Not only is the initial
problem not resolved,

25
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,770
but they've spent hours
not resolving it.

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,730
This outcome negatively
affects you,

27
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,095
your team, and the
organization as a whole.

28
00:01:17,095 --> 00:01:19,920
But it can usually be prevented.

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,030
Many times the situation is

30
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,210
a result of not fully
understanding the issue.

31
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,320
Structured thinking will help you

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,870
understand problems
at a high level so

33
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,030
that you can identify
areas that need

34
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,700
deeper investigation
and understanding.

35
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,960
The starting place for

36
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,450
structured thinking is
the problem domain,

37
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,715
which you might have
remembered from earlier.

38
00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:43,879
Once you know the specific
area of analysis,

39
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,040
you can set your base and lay out

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,270
all your requirements and

41
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,000
hypotheses before you
start investigating.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,130
With a solid base in place,

43
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,345
you'll be ready to deal with
any obstacles that come up.

44
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:56,925
What kind of obstacles?

45
00:01:56,925 --> 00:01:58,070
Well, let's say you're

46
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,630
asked to predict
the future value of

47
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,495
an apartment building
based on a given dataset.

48
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:04,865
You have hundreds
of variables and

49
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:07,675
every one is crucial
to your analysis.

50
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:10,925
But what if one variable
accidentally gets left out,

51
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:13,085
like square footage, for example?

52
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:16,355
You'd have to go back and
redo all your hard work.

53
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:18,590
That's because
missing variables can

54
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,715
lead to inaccurate conclusions.

55
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:23,600
Another way that you can
practice structured thinking and

56
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,700
avoid mistakes is by
using a scope of work.

57
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,440
A scope of work or
SOW is an agreed-

58
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,135
upon outline of the work

59
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:34,615
you're going to
perform on a project.

60
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:36,470
For many businesses, this

61
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,839
includes things
like work details,

62
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:42,395
schedules, and reports that
the client can expect.

63
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,675
Now, as a data analyst,

64
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:46,730
your scope of work
will be a bit more

65
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,620
technical and include

66
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,780
those basic items
we just mentioned,

67
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,430
but you'll also focus on things

68
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,510
like data preparation,
validation,

69
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,090
analysis of quantitative
and qualitative datasets,

70
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,340
initial results, and maybe

71
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,205
even some visuals to really
get the point across.

72
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:05,840
Let's bring a scope of work to

73
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,520
life with a simple example.

74
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,950
Say a couple has hired
a wedding planner.

75
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,495
We'll focus on just one task,
the wedding invitations.

76
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:19,345
Here's what might be in
scope of work: deliverables,

77
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:25,915
timeline, milestones,
and reports.

78
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:30,600
Let's break down just one
of these, deliverables.

79
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,390
The wedding planner and

80
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,390
couple will need to
decide on the invitation,

81
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,485
make a list of people to invite,
collect their addresses,

82
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,740
print the invitations,
address the envelopes,

83
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,125
stamp them, and mail them out.

84
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,265
Now let's check
out the timelines.

85
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:48,800
You'll notice the dates and

86
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,095
the milestones which
keep us on track.

87
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:53,325
Finally, we have the reports,

88
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:55,700
which give our couple
some peace of mind by

89
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,250
telling them when each
step is complete.

90
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,055
A scope of work can be a
simple but powerful tool.

91
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:03,795
With a solid scope of work,

92
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:06,455
you'll be able to
address any confusion,

93
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,770
contradictions, or
questions about the data up-

94
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,880
front and make sure

95
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,595
these sneaky setbacks
don't stand in your way.

96
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:15,290
This is a simple example

97
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,390
of what a scope of
work might look like.

98
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,620
But later, you'll be able to
practice building your own.

99
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,499
Next up in our scope,

100
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:24,050
we'll check out setbacks from

101
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,745
a different angle by learning

102
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:30,050
the importance of contextualizing
data and avoiding bias.

103
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,810
Looking forward to sharing
some cool insights with you.
