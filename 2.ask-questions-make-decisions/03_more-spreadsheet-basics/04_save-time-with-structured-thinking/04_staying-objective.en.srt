00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,430
Welcome back. In this video,

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,940
we'll explore the importance
of contextualizing data,

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,270
and recognizing data
bias. Let's get started.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,960
Data doesn't live in a
vacuum, it needs context.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,010
Earlier, we learnt
that context is

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,865
the condition in which
something exists or happens.

7
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:22,840
Actions can be appropriate
in some context,

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,000
but inappropriate in others,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,595
for example, yelling move,

10
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:29,510
is rude one context,

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,945
if your friend is standing
in front of the TV,

12
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:34,480
but it's entirely
appropriate in another,

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,980
if that friend is about to

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,130
get hit by a kid on a tricycle.

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,070
Do you see the difference?

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,540
In the world of data,

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,055
numbers don't mean
much without context.

18
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:46,090
I'll let my fellow Googler Ed,

19
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,960
tell you a little
bit more about that

20
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,945
As we have more and more
data available to us.

21
00:00:50,945 --> 00:00:52,240
We can leverage that data

22
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,190
in increasingly
sophisticated ways,

23
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,070
and generate more powerful
insights from it.

24
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,755
We use data at many
different levels.

25
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:01,840
Sometimes our data
is descriptive,

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,610
answering questions like, how

27
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,635
much did we spend on
travel last month?

28
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:07,390
Data becomes more valuable,

29
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,300
as we generate diagnostic
and predictive insights,

30
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,375
like understanding why travel
spend increased last month.

31
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,460
Data is most valuable, however,

32
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,755
when we can generate
prescriptive insights.

33
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:19,810
For example, how can we leverage

34
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,765
data to incentivize
more efficient travel?

35
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:25,450
Figuring out what data means,

36
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,865
is just as important
as collecting it.

37
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:29,375
As a data analyst,

38
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,000
a big part of your job,

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,375
is putting data into context.

40
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,750
It's also up to you,

41
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,775
to remain objective and recognize

42
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:40,570
all sides of an argument,
before drawing conclusions.

43
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,340
The thing about context,

44
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,320
is that it's very personal.

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,200
If two people curate
the same data set,

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,105
and follow the same directions,

47
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:52,150
there's a chance they will end
up with different results.

48
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,370
Why? Because there is

49
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,895
no universal set of
contextual interpretations.

50
00:01:57,895 --> 00:02:01,025
Everyone approaches
it in their own way.

51
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:04,300
Even if the data collection
process is correct,

52
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,375
the analysis can still
be misinterpreted.

53
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,610
Conclusions can be influenced by

54
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,235
your own conscious and
subconscious biases,

55
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:14,080
which are based on cultural,

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,595
social and market norms.

57
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,330
For example, if you
ask a Boston resident,

58
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,850
which baseball team is the best,

59
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,275
chances are, they're going
to say Boston Red Sox.

60
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:29,260
Which brings us to a major
limitation of data analytics.

61
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,140
If the analysis is not objective,

62
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,700
the conclusions
can be misleading.

63
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,330
To really understand
what the data is about,

64
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,495
you have to think
through who, what,

65
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:44,635
where, when, how and why.

66
00:02:44,635 --> 00:02:47,195
It's good to ask
yourself questions like,

67
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:48,870
who collected the data?

68
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,045
And what is it about?

69
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:54,015
What does the data
represent in the world,

70
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:56,560
and how does it
relate to other data?

71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,825
When, was the data collected?

72
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:00,625
Data collected awhile ago

73
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,290
may have certain limitations,

74
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,390
given the present day situation.

75
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,700
For example, if we collected

76
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,000
phone numbers over the past
century, at some point,

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,460
mobile phones would
have been introduced,

78
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,210
leading to the need for an
additional phone number field.

79
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,060
You should also think about,

80
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,340
where, was the data collected?

81
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,630
A lot can change across cities,

82
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,295
states and countries, and
how was it collected.

83
00:03:27,295 --> 00:03:29,470
A survey might not
be as effective

84
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,095
as an in-person
interview, for example.

85
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:34,720
Of course, there's the, why.

86
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,370
The why can have

87
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,280
a particularly strong
relationship with bias.

88
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,900
Why? Because sometimes,
data is collected,

89
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,370
or even made up, to
serve an agenda.

90
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,020
The best thing you can do for

91
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,180
the fairness and
accuracy of your data,

92
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,770
is to make sure you start with

93
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,770
an accurate representation
of the population,

94
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,480
and collect the data in the most

95
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,695
appropriate, and objective way.

96
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,230
Then, you'll have the facts

97
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,090
so you can pass on to your team.

98
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,070
Hopefully you now understand

99
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,875
the importance of fair
and objective data,

100
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,080
and how important a context is,

101
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,985
when it comes to understanding
and interpreting it.

102
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:15,290
Next up, we'll figure out
how we can bring it to life.
