00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,420
Albert Einstein once
said," If I were

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,910
given one hour to
save the planet,

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,550
I would spend 59 minutes defining

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,850
the problem and one
minute resolving it."

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,875
Now, that might seem extreme,

6
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:16,650
but it does show us just
how important it is

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,815
to define the problems
before trying to solve them.

8
00:00:19,815 --> 00:00:21,225
A lot of times,

9
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:24,810
teams jump right into data
analysis before realizing

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,360
a few months later
that they are either

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,800
solving the wrong problem

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,705
or they don't have
the right data.

13
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:33,540
In this video, we will
learn how to develop

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,660
a structured approach to
defining the problem domain.

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,820
This is important
because if you define

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,830
the problem clearly
from the start,

17
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,830
it'll be easier to solve,

18
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,655
which saves a lot of time,
money, and resources.

19
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:47,945
In the data world,

20
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:50,840
we call this first piece
the problem domain:

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,900
the specific area of
analysis that encompasses

22
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,330
every activity affecting or
affected by the problem.

23
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,635
Before we can do anything else,

24
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:01,820
we need to understand

25
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,670
the problem domain
and all of its parts

26
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,620
and relationships so that we

27
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,930
can discover the whole story.

28
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,880
Actually calling it the first

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,415
piece makes me think
of a jigsaw puzzle.

30
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:14,975
Say you have a puzzle.

31
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,920
Let's think of that puzzle
as our problem domain.

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,240
You have all 500 pieces
but you lost the box.

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,290
So you don't know what
image the puzzle will reveal.

34
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,835
Will it be an animal?

35
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,720
A waterfall? A bowl of oranges?

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,700
Whatever it is, it's going
to be tough trying to

37
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,850
put it together without an
image you can refer to.

38
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,970
Even the greatest puzzler
in the galaxy would

39
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,290
need a new process and

40
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,845
lots of time to
complete that puzzle.

41
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:45,915
Data analysts face the same kinds of challenges too.

42
00:01:45,915 --> 00:01:48,575
You might remember that
data analysts aren't

43
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,480
always given the
complete picture

44
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,985
at the start of a project.

45
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:54,380
A big part of their
job is to develop

46
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,300
a structured approach and use

47
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,760
critical thinking to
find the best solution.

48
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,004
That starts with understanding
the problem domain.

49
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:06,335
This is where structured
thinking comes into play.

50
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:10,070
To successfully solve a
problem as a data analyst,

51
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,515
you need to train your brain
to think structurally.

52
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:15,220
That's exactly what you'll

53
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,430
learn coming up. See you there.
