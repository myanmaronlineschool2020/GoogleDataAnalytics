1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,410
So far we've covered how to
start a new spreadsheet,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,150
enter in data, and make it look

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,180
refined and ready for
some serious analysis.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,830
Now we'll learn how to perform

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,755
calculations in your spreadsheet.

6
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:14,820
You may need to
calculate everything

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,830
from sums to averages,

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,755
to finding minimum
and maximum amounts.

9
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:21,300
You'll use calculations for

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,460
a lot of different
kinds of tasks.

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,655
In this video, we'll focus
on learning the basics

12
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:28,320
and then do a little math with

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,345
some sales data to practice.

14
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:32,440
Let's talk about formulas first.

15
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,090
You might remember that
a formula is a set of

16
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,375
instructions that perform
a specific calculation.

17
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:41,395
Basically, formulas can
do the math for you.

18
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:43,460
Now, they don't only do math,

19
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,230
they can do a lot more.

20
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,690
Soon you'll learn
different ways you can use

21
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,375
them throughout the data
analysis processes.

22
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,870
Formulas are built on operators
which are symbols that

23
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,490
name the type of operation or

24
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,455
calculation to be performed.

25
00:00:57,455 --> 00:01:01,160
For example, a plus sign
is a common operator.

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,770
The formulas you use
as a data analyst will

27
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,455
usually include at
least one operator.

28
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:09,515
Now, let's talk about math
expressions or equations.

29
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:11,900
These can take a lot
of different forms,

30
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,555
but you might be familiar
with them already.

31
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:22,845
3 minus 1, 15 plus 8 divided
by 2, 846 times 513.

32
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:25,325
These are all examples
of expressions.

33
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:28,015
Is this bringing back
memories of grade school?

34
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:29,945
Well, back in math class,

35
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:32,690
you most likely learned to
complete an expression by

36
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,585
including an equal
sign and the solution.

37
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:37,985
It's slightly different
with spreadsheets.

38
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:39,710
When you create a formula using

39
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,659
an expression in a spreadsheet,

40
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:44,465
you start the formula
with an equal sign.

41
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:46,820
For example, if we
want to subtract,

42
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,490
we type an equal sign
followed by the rest of

43
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,410
the expression without any
spaces in the formula.

44
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,500
Now let's try an expression

45
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,300
that's a bit more challenging.

46
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,540
We'll type 31982, then

47
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:08,940
a hyphen for a minus
sign, then 17795.

48
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,000
To calculate, we press "Enter."

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,610
You'll most likely use

50
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,320
formulas this way
when dealing with

51
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,099
large numbers or expressions
with multiple steps.

52
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,430
Here are the operators you
will use to complete formulas.

53
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,200
The plus sign for addition,

54
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,750
the minus or hyphen
for subtraction,

55
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,865
the asterisk for multiplication,

56
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:31,570
and the forward
slash for division.

57
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,190
The division and
multiplication symbols

58
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,380
might be different than
what you're used to.

59
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,190
Small changes, but
important to keep in mind.

60
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,660
If you already have data
in your spreadsheet,

61
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,780
you can use cell references
in your formulas instead.

62
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,630
A cell reference is
a single cell or

63
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,680
range of cells in

64
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,305
a worksheet that can
be used in a formula.

65
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,600
Cell references
contain the letter of

66
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,570
the column and the number of
the row where the data is.

67
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,365
A range of cells is a
collection of two or more cells.

68
00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:02,990
A range can include cells
from the same row or column,

69
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,810
or from different columns
and rows collected together.

70
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,810
We'll show you an example
in an upcoming video.

71
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,070
Now let's apply what we just
learned to some sales data.

72
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,360
If we want to add
these figures to find

73
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,060
the total sales for
the first row of data,

74
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,720
you can click "cell F2".

75
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,690
From there, we'll start
with an equal sign and use

76
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,015
the cell references to input
values in your expression.

77
00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:31,425
We're starting with cell
B2 because the year in

78
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:35,460
A2 is not a value we want
to add to the total.

79
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,460
Then press "Enter."

80
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,815
Just like that,

81
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:45,730
your total sales has
been calculated for you,

82
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,600
but what if you realized one of

83
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,350
the values in your
data was wrong?

84
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,465
No problem.

85
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:52,900
You can change the
value in any cell using

86
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,910
the formula and the total
will update automatically.

87
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,580
The great thing about using
cell references is that they

88
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,380
also automatically update when

89
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,325
a formula is copied
to a new cell.

90
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:13,260
Talk about a time-saver.

91
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,710
Instead of entering
the same formula again

92
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,500
for every new set
of cell references,

93
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,420
just copy the formula using

94
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,980
the menu or a keyboard
shortcut like Control plus C.

95
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,990
Then paste the formula where
you want to apply it using

96
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:36,160
Control plus V. And presto!

97
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,435
The formula updates

98
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:39,580
all the new cells and
values correctly.

99
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,240
Now let's say you also want
it to find the average sales.

100
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,210
For this, you create a new
formula in a different cell.

101
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,900
To group values in a
formula, use parentheses.

102
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,110
This lets your spreadsheet know
which values to calculate

103
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,710
together and the order of the
operations to be performed.

104
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,200
For example, open parentheses,

105
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:20,510
then B2 plus C2 plus D2 plus E2,

106
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,810
and close parentheses,
then divide

107
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,195
the value of all of this
by typing slash four.

108
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:31,475
You are adding the values
in the four cells together

109
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:34,520
and then using the slash to
divide the total by four,

110
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,170
and just like the last one,

111
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,270
we can copy and
paste the formula.

112
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,790
Here's another formula you
can use if you want to find

113
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,180
the percent change in sales
between June and July.

114
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,310
Once a formula
calculates the value,

115
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,990
you can then use the percent button

116
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,850
to change the value
to a percentage.

117
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,190
When you apply the formula
to the other rows,

118
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,660
both the formula and

119
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,705
the percent will
automatically update.

120
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,015
That doesn't look like
the right answer.

121
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,395
Looks like we've got
an error. Don't worry.

122
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:19,475
Errors can happen at any
stage of data analysis,

123
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:21,940
and that includes when
you're using spreadsheets.

124
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,630
A formula has to be air tight.

125
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,270
If there's something
wrong with one of

126
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,370
the cell references,
it won't work.

127
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,840
So what's our error?

128
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,120
Well, we can see that the
value in cell D4 is missing.

129
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,650
It might take some
time and research on

130
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,740
your part to find the correct
value, but it's worth it.

131
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,845
You want your analysis to
be as accurate as possible.

132
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:44,420
When you do add the value,

133
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,550
the formula takes
care of the rest.

134
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,885
That was a lot to take in.

135
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:53,160
Thanks for staying with me.

136
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,740
You'll be able to apply what you

137
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,870
learned about formulas
here and later

138
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,250
in the program to make

139
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,725
your analysis more
efficient and your job,

140
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:02,090
a little easier, and

141
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,345
soon you'll work in
your own spreadsheet.

142
00:07:04,345 --> 00:07:07,000
Happy spreadsheeting.
