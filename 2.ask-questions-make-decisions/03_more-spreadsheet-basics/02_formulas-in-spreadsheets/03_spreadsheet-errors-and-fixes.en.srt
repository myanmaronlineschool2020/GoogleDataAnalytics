1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Hi and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,265
Recently we've been
learning about formulas.

3
00:00:05,265 --> 00:00:07,440
Sometimes data
analysts encounter

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,365
a problem with our formulas
and we get an error.

5
00:00:10,365 --> 00:00:13,305
We've all been there and
it can be frustrating.

6
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,180
But there are solutions,

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,700
that's what we're going
to explore in this video.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,850
One error you may encounter
is the DIV error.

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,060
The DIV error happens when a
formula is trying to divide

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,320
a value in a cell by zero
or by an empty cell.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,030
In this spreadsheet,

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,040
the percentage
Complete values in

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,400
column C are calculated by

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,750
dividing the values in

15
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,030
the Tasks Completed column by

16
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,090
the values in the
Required Tasks column.

17
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,025
Notice that column C is

18
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:45,835
already formatted
as a percentage.

19
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:49,190
The DIV error is in
cell C4 because we're

20
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,365
dividing by zero the
value in cell A4.

21
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:54,890
To avoid this problem,

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,075
we can have this spreadsheet

23
00:00:56,075 --> 00:00:58,685
automatically enter
not applicable

24
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:00,770
whenever a cell in column A

25
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,565
contains a zero that
would cause the error.

26
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:07,205
To do this, we'll use
the IFERROR function.

27
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:09,230
If it encounters a DIV error

28
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,480
caused by a cell that
contains the zero,

29
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,800
the phrase "Not applicable"
will be inserted.

30
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,040
We can also copy the formula
to the rest of the cells in

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,960
column C so it checks for

32
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,770
any other cells that
contain a zero.

33
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,145
Now let's move on to ERROR.

34
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:30,330
In Google Sheets,

35
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,780
ERROR tells us the formula can't

36
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,600
be interpreted as it is input.

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,070
This is also known
as a parsing error.

38
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,360
Say we want to
tally the number of

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,405
total tasks in column B and C,

40
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:46,600
we use the SUM function,

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,675
but the formula
equal sum B2 to B6,

42
00:01:51,675 --> 00:01:55,860
C2 to C6 causes an error.

43
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,295
Examining it more closely,

44
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:00,650
we see that a comma
is missing between

45
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,990
the cell ranges B2
to B6 and C2 to C6.

46
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,140
We can fix this by inserting
a comma between the cell

47
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,010
ranges to indicate the
end of each data item.

48
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,275
This is called a delimiter,

49
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,740
which you will learn
more about soon.

50
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,150
Now, the formula can correctly

51
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,715
calculate the total
number of tasks as 25.

52
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:29,085
Another type of error is N/A.

53
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:32,420
The N/A error tells
you that the data

54
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,250
in your formula can't be
found by the spreadsheet.

55
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,090
Generally, this means
the data doesn't exist.

56
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,340
This error most often occurs

57
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,710
when using functions
such as VLOOKUP,

58
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,620
which searches for a
certain value in a column

59
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,750
to return a corresponding
piece of information.

60
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,545
Here, we see a master list
of nuts and their prices.

61
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:58,840
Using VLOOKUP, the spreadsheet
finds prices in the list,

62
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,120
then calculates the prices for

63
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,490
each store using the
assigned markup.

64
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,885
But we have a N/A error
in cells B49 and C49.

65
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:11,445
The VLOOKUP formula is correct,

66
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:13,180
so what's going on?

67
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,030
Well, if we look carefully
at the name of the nut,

68
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,925
"almond" has no match
in the lookup table,

69
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:23,050
the lookup table uses the
plural "almonds" instead.

70
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,370
So we change almond to almonds,

71
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,180
and with that typo fixed,

72
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,930
the right prices are filled in.

73
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,560
Speaking of typos, sometimes

74
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,020
a typo can cause a NAME error.

75
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,910
A NAME error can happen when

76
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,945
a formula's name isn't
recognized or understood.

77
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:44,160
Suppose we see a NAME error

78
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,155
in the nut prices spreadsheet.

79
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:47,540
If we look carefully,

80
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,800
the VLOOKUP function in cell
B21 is spelled incorrectly,

81
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,935
it has one extra O;

82
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:55,910
this causes a NAME error for

83
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,680
both the price and

84
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,875
the resulting markup
calculation for the store.

85
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,270
To fix this error,

86
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,850
we can delete the
extra O in VLOOKUP.

87
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,820
Perfect. Sometimes an error

88
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,865
is caused by inconsistent
or wrong data.

89
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:16,790
For instance, the NUM
error tells us that

90
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,280
a formula's calculation can't

91
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,140
be performed as
specified by the data.

92
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,895
The data doesn't make sense
for that calculation.

93
00:04:25,895 --> 00:04:27,290
Here's what I mean.

94
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,550
Suppose we're working on

95
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,890
a large construction
project using

96
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,510
a spreadsheet to track

97
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,335
how many months it takes
to reach key milestones.

98
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:39,710
We can use the
DATEDIF function to

99
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,300
calculate the number of months

100
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,505
between start and end dates.

101
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:45,650
The function requires
the start date

102
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,790
to be in the first cell

103
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,770
referenced and the end date

104
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,890
to be in the second
cell referenced.

105
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:55,195
In our case, cells B2
and C2 respectively.

106
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,100
The M represents months,

107
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,920
as we want this spreadsheet
to calculate the number of

108
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,920
months between our
start and end dates.

109
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,420
But we get a NUM
error in cell D6.

110
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,655
We notice that the end date
comes before the start date,

111
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:12,589
so the DATEDIF function

112
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:15,740
can't calculate the
number of months between.

113
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,290
It's likely the
start and end dates

114
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,765
were interchanged by accident.

115
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:24,065
We can request verification
of the data to make sure.

116
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:26,810
In the meantime, let's
reverse the order of

117
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,670
the cells in the formula to

118
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,710
temporarily get
around the error.

119
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,910
Now, the result is nine months.

120
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,020
What if the client's
name was accidentally

121
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,055
inserted into the start
date in the spreadsheet?

122
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:44,340
You guessed it, we get an error.

123
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,400
The VALUE error can indicate

124
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,715
a problem with a formula
or referenced cells.

125
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:53,195
It's often not clear right
away what the problem is,

126
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:56,515
so this error might take a
little more effort to fix.

127
00:05:56,515 --> 00:06:00,710
In this case, John Welty was
input as the start date,

128
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,960
making the calculation
impossible for

129
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,895
the DATEDIF function
in the cell D6.

130
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:10,250
We just replace the
text, John Welty,

131
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,230
with the correct start date
of September 1st, 2016.

132
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,435
Last is the REF error,

133
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:23,550
which often comes
up when cells being

134
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,305
referenced in a formula
have been deleted,

135
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:28,210
thus making the formula unable

136
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,395
to perform the calculation.

137
00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:33,040
Here's a spreadsheet
used to calculate

138
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,155
the number of seats available
for a company lunch.

139
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:37,720
Let's say the company

140
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,970
decided not to run
the second floor,

141
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,070
so we delete row 4.

142
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,680
This results in a REF error when

143
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,740
calculating the total seats
available in cell B5.

144
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,920
To fix this, we can
change the formula to

145
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,465
add the values in
cells B2 and B3.

146
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:57,665
Also, in this case,

147
00:06:57,665 --> 00:06:58,880
we could have prevented

148
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,880
the REF error by using
the SUM function and

149
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,040
a range of cells
instead of adding

150
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,345
the cell value by
direct reference.

151
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:09,900
Now, if we delete row 10,

152
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,380
the SUM function
calculates the total seats

153
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,870
available. There you go.

154
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,010
We've now fixed some of

155
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,200
the most common
spreadsheet errors.

156
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,475
When you see them again,

157
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:20,920
you'll know what they mean.

158
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,405
Troubleshooting is a big
part of data analysis,

159
00:07:24,405 --> 00:07:26,705
so being able to find solutions

160
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:30,030
is a key skill for
data analysts.
