1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
Formulas are a
great way to become

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,550
more efficient when
using spreadsheets,

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,845
especially when you add shortcuts

4
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:10,755
like copying and
pasting, into the mix.

5
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:12,810
As you progress as
a data analyst,

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,070
you'll most likely learn

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,169
more shortcuts to
help your process.

8
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:18,930
But now it's time to
move on to functions.

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,555
While they're closely
related to formulas,

10
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,505
they're not exactly the same.

11
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:25,260
By the end of this video,

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,030
you'll understand
the difference and

13
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,055
know when to use them both.

14
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:30,750
In the world of spreadsheets

15
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,640
a function is a
preset command that

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,010
automatically performs
a specific process

17
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,945
or task using the data.

18
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:38,970
You might remember
some of the shortcuts

19
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,185
we learned that can be
used with formulas.

20
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:44,900
Think of functions as the
most useful of the shortcuts.

21
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,820
The good news is a lot of

22
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,860
spreadsheet functions have names

23
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,435
that tell you what they do.

24
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:52,670
There are tons of
functions out there.

25
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,890
As you continue to work
with spreadsheets,

26
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,665
you'll find that you
use certain ones a lot,

27
00:00:57,665 --> 00:01:00,155
and others, rarely or not at all.

28
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:01,760
For now, let's take a look

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,170
at some of the
functions that we can

30
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,170
apply to our sales data
from the previous video.

31
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,765
We'll start with total sales.

32
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:14,189
Let's use the SUM function
for this in cell F2.

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,790
The first steps are pretty

34
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,085
similar to what we did
in the last video.

35
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:20,960
First, we'll select the cell

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,480
where we want the
calculation to appear.

37
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,630
Type equals, then add the
word SUM as our function.

38
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,770
One of the great
things about functions

39
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,900
is they don't always
need operators,

40
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,670
like a plus sign for addition.

41
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,339
In this case, after
the open parentheses,

42
00:01:37,339 --> 00:01:38,780
you can go ahead and select

43
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,400
the range of cells you're adding.

44
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,540
A colon between the
cell references

45
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,415
shows that you're using a range.

46
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:50,165
In this case, the range includes
cells from the same row.

47
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:53,620
After the closed
parentheses, we press Enter.

48
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,530
Just like that, our total
sales number appears.

49
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,290
Just like the formula
we used before,

50
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,300
functions can be
copied and pasted

51
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,630
into other cells in
the same column.

52
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,480
But let's undo that
step so that you can

53
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,220
see another way to copy
a function or formula.

54
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,090
Spreadsheets have something
called a fill handle.

55
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,140
It's a little box that appears in

56
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,485
the lower right-hand corner
when you click on a cell.

57
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:26,705
If you rest your
cursor on the box,

58
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:28,850
you can then drag
the fill handle to

59
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,610
the other boxes in the
same row or column.

60
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,365
Any formula or function
in that cell will

61
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:40,135
automatically be added to
the cells you fill plus,

62
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:42,590
the fill handle will
update the formula so

63
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,330
the cell references match

64
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,670
the row of the columns
of the cells you fill.

65
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,390
This means the formula
is calculated based

66
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,165
on the data in each
separate row or column.

67
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:01,895
Filling won't work
for every situation,

68
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:04,040
but it's still a
pretty great trick.

69
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,395
Now let's find the
average sale for

70
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,540
each month using the
AVERAGE function.

71
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,810
Different functions perform
different calculations,

72
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,895
but they work in the same way.

73
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:28,760
Keep in mind, not
every calculation

74
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,520
you'll come across has its
own function to help you.

75
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,020
For example, to find

76
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,840
the percent change in sales
between June and July,

77
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,990
you'd use the same formula
you used in an earlier video.

78
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,240
Let's say you're asked to find

79
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,865
the lowest monthly
sales in this data set.

80
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,410
There's a function for that.

81
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,375
It's called the MIN function,

82
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,450
which stands for minimum.

83
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,820
Here's how it works.

84
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,150
Say you need to find the
lowest monthly sales

85
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,350
for the whole set.

86
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,520
All you have to do is
set up the function.

87
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,470
Then after the open parenthesis,

88
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,870
select the values
from all three rows.

89
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,960
This might be
important information

90
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,355
for your stake holders.

91
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:28,070
Let's add color to the
cell with that value,

92
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,200
in your data set to
make it stand out.

93
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,590
In this case, click on cell
D2 and then fill color icon,

94
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,840
which looks like a paint can,

95
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,520
then choose a color.

96
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,200
I'll use yellow here.

97
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,240
You can follow the same steps for

98
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,535
the highest sales by using the,

99
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:50,849
wait for it, MAX function.

100
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,985
Looks like we have
an error message.

101
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:06,175
What could be wrong?

102
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,440
We forgot to include

103
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,725
an open parentheses
after the function.

104
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:14,840
No worries, it's a quick fix.

105
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,020
But this is a good reminder
to continually check

106
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,490
the format of your functions and

107
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,110
formulas as you use them.

108
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,970
We'll learn more
about Error messages

109
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,780
and how to work with them later.

110
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,930
That's better. Now we'll add

111
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,060
color to the cell with
the highest sales too.

112
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,645
This is just one way
to highlight key data.

113
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:44,615
You'll find out about
some others later.

114
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:47,330
You've now had a peek
at some ways you

115
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,625
can add and organize
data in a spreadsheet.

116
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,310
You've also seen how
powerful formulas and

117
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,780
functions can be when
applied to real world data.

118
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,230
As a data analyst,

119
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,790
this is just the beginning of

120
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,530
your experience
with spreadsheets.

121
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,820
You'll soon find out

122
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,175
how much more spreadsheets
have to offer.

123
00:06:04,175 --> 00:06:06,020
In the meantime, you're free to

124
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,699
practice some of these formulas,

125
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:10,235
functions, and other
processes on your own.

126
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:11,950
It can be fun to experiment,

127
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,910
and see all that
spreadsheets can do.

128
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,440
Soon, you will switch from

129
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,375
spreadsheets to
structured thinking.

130
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,630
The data analytics pieces are
starting to fit together.

131
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,600
Exciting stuff is coming
right up. So stick around.
