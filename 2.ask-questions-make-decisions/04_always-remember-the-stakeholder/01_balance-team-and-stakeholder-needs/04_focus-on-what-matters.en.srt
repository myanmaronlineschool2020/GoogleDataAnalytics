1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,630
So now that we know the
importance of finding

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,610
the balance across
your stakeholders

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,970
and your team members.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,940
I want to talk about
the importance of

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,249
staying focused on the objective.

6
00:00:11,249 --> 00:00:13,350
This can be tricky when you find

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,270
yourself working
with a lot of people

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,390
with competing needs
and opinions. But by

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,520
asking yourself a
few simple questions

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,305
at the beginning of each task,

11
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:23,850
you can ensure that

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,560
you're able to stay focused on

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,340
your objective while still
balancing stakeholder needs.

14
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,950
Let's think about our
employee turnover example

15
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,345
from the last video.

16
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:35,730
There, we were
dealing with a lot of

17
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,930
different team members and
stakeholders like managers,

18
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,835
administrators, even
other analysts.

19
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:43,415
As a data analyst,

20
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:45,770
you'll find that
balancing everyone's needs

21
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,100
can be a little chaotic sometimes

22
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,690
but part of your
job is to look past

23
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,555
the clutter and stay
focused on the objective.

24
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:55,730
It's important to concentrate on

25
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,525
what matters and
not get distracted.

26
00:00:58,525 --> 00:00:59,945
As a data analyst,

27
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:02,990
you could be working on
multiple projects with lots of

28
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,510
different people but no matter

29
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,370
what project you're working on,

30
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,050
there are three things you can

31
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,810
focus on that will
help you stay on task.

32
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,325
One, who are the primary
and secondary stakeholders?

33
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:19,700
Two who is managing the data?

34
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,440
And three where can you go for help?

35
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,370
Let's see if we can apply

36
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,920
those questions to
our example project.

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,990
The first question you can ask is

38
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,215
about who those stakeholders are.

39
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:34,040
The primary stakeholder of

40
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,890
this project is probably
the Vice President of

41
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,720
HR who's hoping to use

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,400
his project's findings to make

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,210
new decisions about
company policy.

44
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,200
You'd also be giving updates to

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,525
your project manager,
team members,

46
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,610
or other data analysts who are

47
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,595
depending on your work
for their own task.

48
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:55,325
These are your
secondary stakeholders.

49
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:58,040
Take time at the beginning
of every project to

50
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,205
identify your stakeholders
and their goals.

51
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:04,990
Then see who else is on your team
and what their roles are.

52
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,250
Next, you'll want to ask
who's managing the data?

53
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,280
For example, think about

54
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,950
working with other
analysts on this project.

55
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,540
You're all data analysts,

56
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,690
but you may manage different
data within your project.

57
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,960
In our example, there
was another data analyst

58
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,215
who was focused on managing
the company's hiring data.

59
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:27,185
Their insights around
a surge of new hires

60
00:02:27,185 --> 00:02:29,240
18 months ago turned out to

61
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,570
be a key part of your analysis.

62
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,040
If you hadn't communicated
with this person,

63
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,170
you might have spent
a lot of time trying

64
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,300
to collect or analyze hiring data

65
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,940
yourself or you may not have

66
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,000
even been able to include
it in your analysis at all.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,860
Instead, you were able

68
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,540
to communicate your
objectives with

69
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,340
another data analyst and use

70
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,760
existing work to make
your analysis richer.

71
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,415
By understanding who's
managing the data,

72
00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:57,910
you can spend your time
more productively.

73
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,540
Next step, you need to know

74
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,555
where you can go
when you need help.

75
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:03,110
This is something
you should know at

76
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,430
the beginning of any
project you work on.

77
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,830
If you run into bumps in

78
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,110
the road on your way
to completing a task,

79
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,700
you need someone who is best

80
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,450
positioned to take down
those barriers for you.

81
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,485
When you know who's able to help,

82
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:18,530
you'll spend less time worrying
about other aspects of

83
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,115
the project and more time
focused on the objective.

84
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:24,350
So who could you go to if you

85
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,485
ran into a problem
on this project?

86
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:28,940
Project managers support you and

87
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,850
your work by managing
the project timeline,

88
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,430
providing guidance and resources,

89
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,105
and setting up
efficient workflows.

90
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:40,115
They have a big picture
view of the project

91
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:41,870
because they know what you

92
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,030
and the rest of the
team are doing.

93
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,190
This makes them a great resource

94
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,825
if you run into a problem

95
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:49,970
in the employee turnover example,

96
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,470
you would need to
be able to access

97
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,300
employee departure survey data

98
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,070
to include in your analysis.

99
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,600
If you're having trouble getting

100
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,294
approvals for that access,

101
00:03:58,294 --> 00:04:00,860
you can speak with your
project manager to remove

102
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,450
those barriers for
you so that you

103
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,565
can move forward
with your project.

104
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:06,710
Your team depends on you to stay

105
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,365
focused on your task
so that as a team,

106
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:11,080
you can find solutions.

107
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,940
By asking yourself
three easy questions

108
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,635
at the beginning of new projects,

109
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:18,230
you'll be able to address
stakeholder needs,

110
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,250
feel confident about who is
managing the data, and get

111
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,110
help when you need it so that

112
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,450
you can keep your
eyes on the prize:

113
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,960
the project objective. So far

114
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,630
we've covered the importance
of working effectively on

115
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,905
a team while maintaining your
focus on stakeholder needs.

116
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:39,350
Coming up, we'll go over some
practical ways to become

117
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,510
better communicators
so that we can

118
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,300
help make sure the team
reaches its goals.
