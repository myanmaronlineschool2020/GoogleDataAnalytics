00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,015
Hey, welcome back.

2
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:06,030
So far you've learned about
things like spreadsheets,

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,110
analytical thinking skills,
metrics, and mathematics.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,260
These are all super
important technical skills

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,520
that you'll build on throughout

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,215
your Data Analytics career.

7
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:18,120
You should also keep in mind that

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,040
there are some
non-technical skills that

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,120
you can use to create

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,135
a positive and productive
working environment.

11
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:27,150
These skills will help
you consider the way you

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,470
interact with your colleagues

13
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,300
as well as your stakeholders.

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,720
We already know that
it's important to keep

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,455
your team members' and
stakeholders' needs in mind.

16
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:38,370
Coming up, we'll talk
about why that is.

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,490
We'll start learning
some communication

18
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,715
best practices you can use
in your day to day work.

19
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:47,305
Remember, communication is key.

20
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:48,800
We'll start by learning

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,600
all about effective
communication,

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,900
and how to balance team
member and stakeholder needs.

23
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,060
Think of these
skills as new tools

24
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,980
that'll help you work
with your team to

25
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,545
find the best possible solutions.

26
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:04,470
Alright, let's head on to the next
video and get started.
