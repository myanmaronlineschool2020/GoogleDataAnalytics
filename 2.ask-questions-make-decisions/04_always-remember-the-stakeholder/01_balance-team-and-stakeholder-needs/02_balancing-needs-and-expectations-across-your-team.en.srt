1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,445
As a data analyst,

2
00:00:02,445 --> 00:00:05,850
you'll be required to focus
on a lot of different things,

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,040
And your stakeholders'
expectations are

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,945
one of the most important.

5
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:11,610
We're going to talk about why

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,160
stakeholder expectations
are so important to

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,450
your work and look at

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,585
some examples of stakeholder
needs on a project.

9
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:22,110
By now you've heard me use
the term stakeholder a lot.

10
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,540
So let's refresh ourselves
on what a stakeholder is.

11
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,560
Stakeholders are people that

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,960
have invested time, interest,

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,180
and resources into
the projects that

14
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,730
you'll be working on
as a data analyst.

15
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,110
In other words, they hold
stakes in what you're doing.

16
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,965
There's a good
chance they'll need

17
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:43,130
the work you do to
perform their own needs.

18
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,590
That's why it's so
important to make

19
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,470
sure your work lines
up with their needs

20
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,420
and why you need to communicate

21
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,010
effectively with all of

22
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,250
the stakeholders
across your team.

23
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,940
Your stakeholders will want to

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,370
discuss things like
the project objective,

25
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,410
what you need to reach that goal,

26
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,590
and any challenges or
concerns you have.

27
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,320
This is a good thing.

28
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,250
These conversations help build

29
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,745
trust and confidence
in your work.

30
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:11,120
Here's an example of

31
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,220
a project with
multiple team members.

32
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,920
Let's explore what
they might need from

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,480
you at different levels to
reach the project's goal.

34
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,980
Imagine you're a data
analyst working with

35
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,545
a company's human
resources department.

36
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:26,240
The company has experienced

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,340
an increase in its turnover rate,

38
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,520
which is the rate at which
employees leave a company.

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,940
The company's HR department
wants to know why that

40
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,740
is and they want you to help them

41
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,905
figure out potential solutions.

42
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:42,005
The Vice President of
HR at this company is

43
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:45,140
interested in identifying
any shared patterns

44
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,140
across employees who quit
and seeing if there's

45
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,755
a connection to employee
productivity and engagement.

46
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:53,195
As a data analyst,

47
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:54,860
it's your job to focus on

48
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,750
the HR department's question and

49
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,855
help find them an answer.

50
00:01:58,855 --> 00:02:01,790
But the VP might be
too busy to manage

51
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,880
day-to-day tasks or might
not be your direct contact.

52
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,950
For this task, you'll be updating

53
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,200
the project manager
more regularly.

54
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,330
Project managers are in charge of

55
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,795
planning and executing a project.

56
00:02:13,795 --> 00:02:17,720
Part of the project manager's
job is keeping the project

57
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,905
on track and overseeing the
progress of the entire team.

58
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:26,269
In most cases, you'll need to
give them regular updates,

59
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:28,610
let them know what you
need to succeed and

60
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,730
tell them if you have any
problems along the way.

61
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,565
You might also be working
with other team members.

62
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:37,220
For example, HR administrators

63
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,900
will need to know
the metrics you're

64
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,940
using so that they
can design ways

65
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,460
to effectively gather
employee data.

66
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,960
You might even be working with

67
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,340
other data analysts who are

68
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,610
covering different
aspects of the data.

69
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,810
It's so important
that you know who

70
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,810
the stakeholders and
other team members are in

71
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,980
a project so that you can

72
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,620
communicate with
them effectively and

73
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,300
give them what they need to move

74
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,960
forward in their own
roles on the project.

75
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,190
You're all working
together to give

76
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,220
the company vital insights
into this problem.

77
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,795
Back to our example.

78
00:03:08,795 --> 00:03:11,045
By analyzing company data,

79
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:13,970
you see a decrease in
employee engagement and

80
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,575
performance after their first
13 months at the company,

81
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:20,450
which could mean that employees

82
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,340
started feeling demotivated or

83
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,350
disconnected from their work

84
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,310
and then often quit
a few months later.

85
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,600
Another analyst who focuses on

86
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,610
hiring data also shares that

87
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,740
the company had a large increase

88
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,340
in hiring around 18 months ago.

89
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,359
You communicate this information

90
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:39,980
with all your team members and

91
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,200
stakeholders and they provide

92
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,590
feedback on how to share this
information with your VP.

93
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,880
In the end, your VP decides
to implement an in-depth

94
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,280
manager check-in with
employees who are

95
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,995
about to hit their 12
month mark at the firm

96
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:58,070
to identify career growth
opportunities, which

97
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,780
reduces the employee turnover

98
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,915
starting at the
13 month mark.

99
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:04,580
This is just one example
of how you might

100
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,780
balance needs and expectations
across your team.

101
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,460
You'll find that in
pretty much every project

102
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,320
you work on as a data analyst,

103
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,180
different people on your team,

104
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,510
from the VP of HR to your
fellow data analysts,

105
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,460
will need all your focus and

106
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,535
communication to carry
the project to success.

107
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:25,295
Focusing on stakeholder
expectations

108
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:28,295
will help you understand
the goal of a project,

109
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:31,115
communicate more effectively
across your team,

110
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:33,010
and build trust in your work.

111
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,880
Coming up, we'll discuss how to

112
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,085
figure out where you
fit on your team

113
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:38,960
and how you can
help move a project

114
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,420
forward with focus
and determination.
