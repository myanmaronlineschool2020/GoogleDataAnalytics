1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,243
We discussed before how
data has limitations.

2
00:00:03,243 --> 00:00:07,204
Sometimes you don't have
access to the data you need, or

3
00:00:07,204 --> 00:00:11,440
your data sources aren't aligned or
your data is unclean.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,019
This can definitely be a problem
when you're analyzing data, but

5
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:18,940
it can also affect your communication
with your stakeholders.

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,555
That's why it's important to balance your
stakeholders' expectations with what is

7
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:25,441
actually possible for a project.

8
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:30,153
We're going to learn about the importance
of setting realistic, objective goals and

9
00:00:30,153 --> 00:00:33,639
how to best communicate with
your stakeholders about problems

10
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:35,640
you might run into.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,450
Keep in mind that a lot of
things depend on your analysis.

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,630
Maybe your team can't make
a decision without your report.

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,025
Or maybe your initial data
work will determine how and

14
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,680
where additional data will be gathered.

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,366
You might remember that
we've talked about some

16
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:55,496
situations where it's important to
loop stakeholders in. For example,

17
00:00:55,496 --> 00:01:00,740
telling your project manager if you're on
schedule or if you're having a problem.

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,417
Now, let's look at a real-life example
where you need to communicate with

19
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:08,040
stakeholders and what you might
do if you run into a problem.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,340
Let's say you're working on a project for
an insurance company.

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,776
The company wants to identify common
causes of minor car accidents so

22
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,140
that they can develop educational
materials that encourage safer driving.

23
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,460
There's a few early questions you and
your team need to answer.

24
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,310
What driving habits will you
include in your dataset?

25
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,740
How will you gather this data?

26
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,269
How long will it take you to collect and

27
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:36,631
clean that data before you can use
it in your analysis? Right away

28
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:41,601
you want to communicate clearly with your
stakeholders to answer these questions,

29
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:46,440
so you and your team can set a reasonable
and realistic timeline for the project.

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,039
It can be tempting to tell your
stakeholders that you'll have this done in

31
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,540
no time, no problem.

32
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,020
But setting expectations for a realistic
timeline will help you in the long run.

33
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,515
Your stakeholders will know what to
expect when, and you won't be overworking

34
00:02:00,515 --> 00:02:03,960
yourself and missing deadlines
because you overpromised.

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,870
I find that setting expectations early
helps me spend my time more productively.

36
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:13,068
So as you're getting started, you'll
want to send a high-level schedule with

37
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:16,780
different phases of the project and
their approximate start dates.

38
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,380
In this case, you and your teams
establish that you'll need three weeks to

39
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,739
complete analysis and
provide recommendations, and

40
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:29,240
you let your stakeholders know so
they can plan accordingly.

41
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,640
Now let's imagine you're further along in
the project and you run into a problem.

42
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,494
Maybe drivers have opted into sharing data
about their phone usage in the car, but

43
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:44,540
you discover that some sources count GPS
usage, and some don't in their data.

44
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,702
This might add time to your
data processing and cleaning and

45
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:49,450
delay some project milestones.

46
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,226
You'll want to let your
project manager know and

47
00:02:52,226 --> 00:02:56,000
maybe work out a new timeline
to present to stakeholders.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,440
The earlier you can flag
these problems, the better.

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,340
That way your stakeholders can make
necessary changes as soon as possible.

50
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,810
Or what if your stakeholders want to add
car model or age as possible variables.

51
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,345
You'll have to communicate with them
about how that might change the model

52
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:14,150
you've built,

53
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,896
if it can be added and
before the deadlines, and

54
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,569
any other obstacles that
they need to know so

55
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:24,720
they can decide if it's worth changing at
this stage of the project. To help them

56
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,328
you might prepare a report on how their
request changes the project timeline or

57
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:30,490
alters the model.

58
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,840
You could also outline the pros and
cons of that change.

59
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,502
You want to help your stakeholders achieve
their goals, but it's important to set

60
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:41,650
realistic expectations at
every stage of the project.

61
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,150
This takes some balance.

62
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,271
You've learned about balancing the needs
of your team members and stakeholders, but

63
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:49,869
you also need to balance
stakeholder expectations and

64
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:51,691
what's possible with the projects,

65
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:54,140
resources, and limitations.

66
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,980
That's why it's important to be realistic
and objective and communicate clearly.

67
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,417
This will help stakeholders
understand the timeline and

68
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:06,340
have confidence in your ability
to achieve those goals.

69
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,327
So we know communication is key and

70
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:12,250
we have some good rules to follow
for our professional communication.

71
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,080
Coming up

72
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,866
we'll talk even more about
answering stakeholder questions,

73
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:19,960
delivering data and
communicating with your team.
