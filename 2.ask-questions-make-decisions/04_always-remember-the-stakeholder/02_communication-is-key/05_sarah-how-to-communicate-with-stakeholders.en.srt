00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,170
I'm Sarah and
I'm a senior analytical leader at

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,715
Google. As a data analyst, there's going
to be times where you have different

3
00:00:12,715 --> 00:00:17,928
stakeholders who have no idea about
the amount of time that it takes you to do

4
00:00:17,928 --> 00:00:22,975
each project, and in the very beginning
when I'm asked to do a project or

5
00:00:22,975 --> 00:00:27,940
to look into something, I always try
to give a little bit of expectation

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,460
settings on the turn around
because most of your stakeholders

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,611
don't really understand what you do
with data and how you get it and

8
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:39,960
how you clean it and
put together the story behind it.

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,944
The other thing that I want to
make clear to everyone is that

10
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:49,840
you have to make sure that
the data tells you the stories.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,713
Sometimes people think that
data can answer everything and

12
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:59,790
sometimes we have to acknowledge
that that is simply untrue.

13
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:05,072
I recently worked with a state to figure
out why people weren't signing up for

14
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:08,170
the benefits that they needed and
deserved.

15
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,100
We saw people coming to the site

16
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,010
and where they would sign up for those
benefits and see if they're qualified.

17
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,792
But for some reason there was something
stopping them from taking the step of

18
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:21,220
actually signing up.

19
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,651
So I was able to look into it using
Google Analytics to try to uncover what is

20
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:30,583
stopping people from taking the action of
signing up for these benefits that they

21
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:31,740
need and deserve.

22
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,668
And so I go into Google Analytics,

23
00:01:33,668 --> 00:01:36,792
I see people are going back
between this service page and

24
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:41,330
the unemployment page back to the service
page, back to the unemployment page.

25
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:46,871
And so I came up with a theory that hey,
people aren't finding the information that

26
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:52,270
they need in order to take the next step
to see if they qualify for these services.

27
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,099
The only way that I can actually know why

28
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:59,490
someone left the site without
taking action is if I ask them.

29
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,160
I would have to survey them.

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,851
Google Analytics did not give
me the data that I would need

31
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:08,990
to 100% back my theory or deny it.

32
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,690
So when you're explaining
to your stakeholders,

33
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,050
"Hey I have a theory.

34
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,190
This data is telling me a story.

35
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,710
However I can't 100% know due
to the limitations of data,"

36
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,960
You just have to say it.

37
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,919
So the way that I communicate that
is I say "I have a theory that people

38
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,250
are not finding the information that
they need in order to take action.

39
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,480
Here's the proved points that I
have that support that theory."

40
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,676
So what we did was we then made it
a little bit easier to find that

41
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:43,330
information. Even though
we weren't 100% sure

42
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,955
that my theory was correct, we were
confident enough to take action and then

43
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:52,796
we looked back, and we saw all the metrics
that pointed me to this theory improve. And

44
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:57,203
so that always feels really good when
you're able to help a cause that you

45
00:02:57,203 --> 00:03:00,700
believe in do better,
and help more people through data.

46
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,829
It makes all the nerdy learning about
SQL and everything completely worth it.
