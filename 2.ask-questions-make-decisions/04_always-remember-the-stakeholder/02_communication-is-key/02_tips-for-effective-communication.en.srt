1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,771
No matter where you work,

2
00:00:02,771 --> 00:00:07,540
you'll probably need to communicate with
other people as part of your day to day.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,354
Every organization and every team in
that organization will have different

4
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:15,230
expectations for communication. Coming up,

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,046
We'll learn some practical ways to help
you adapt to those different expectations

6
00:00:20,046 --> 00:00:23,370
and some things that you can
carry over from team to team.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,440
Let's get started.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,913
When you started a new job or a new
project, you might find yourself feeling

9
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:34,190
a little out of sync with the rest of
your team and how they communicate.

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,760
That's totally normal.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,021
You'll figure things out in no time.

12
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:40,201
if you're willing to learn as you go and

13
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:43,340
ask questions when you
aren't sure of something.

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,797
For example, if you find your team uses
acronyms you aren't familiar with,

15
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,080
don't be afraid to ask what they mean.

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,691
When I first started at google,
I had no idea what L G T M

17
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:57,930
meant and
I was always seeing it in comment threads.

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,361
Well, I learned it stands for looks
good to me and I use it all the time

19
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:06,372
now if I need to give
someone my quick feedback,

20
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:09,536
that was one of the many
acronyms I've learned and

21
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:14,040
I come across new ones all the time and
I'm never afraid to ask.

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,640
Every work setting has
some form of etiquette.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,870
Maybe your team members appreciate
eye contact and a firm handshake.

24
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,774
Or it might be more polite to bow,

25
00:01:23,774 --> 00:01:27,870
especially if you find yourself
working with international clients.

26
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,323
You might also discover some specific
etiquette rules just by watching

27
00:01:32,323 --> 00:01:37,081
your coworkers communicate. And
it won't just be in person communication

28
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:37,980
you'll deal with.

29
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,038
Almost 300 billion emails are sent and
received every day and

30
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:47,500
that number is only growing. Fortunately
there are useful skills you

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,156
can learn from those digital
communications too. You'll want

32
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:54,850
your emails to be just as professional
as your in-person communications.

33
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,832
Here are some things that can help you do
that. Good writing practices will go a long

34
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:04,040
way to make your emails professional and
easy to understand.

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,753
Emails are naturally more
formal than texts, but

36
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:10,280
that doesn't mean that you have
to write the next great novel.

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,571
Just taking the time to write complete
sentences that have proper spelling and

38
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:16,401
punctuation will make it clear

39
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:17,451
you took time and

40
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:22,730
consideration in your writing. Emails often
get forwarded to other people to read.

41
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,740
So write clearly enough that
anyone could understand you.

42
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,360
I like to read important emails out
loud before I hit send; that way,

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,666
I can hear if they make sense and
catch any typos. And

44
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:38,840
keep in mind the tone of your
emails can change over time.

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,980
If you find that your team is
fairly casual, that's great.

46
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,299
Once you get to know them better,
you can start being more casual too, but

47
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,500
being professional is always a good
place to start. A good rule of thumb:

48
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,621
Would you be proud of what you had written
if it were published on the front page of

49
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:55,380
a newspaper?

50
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,590
If not revise it until you are. You also
don't want your emails to be too long.

51
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,878
Think about what your team member needs
to know and get to the point instead of

52
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,434
overwhelming them with a wall of text.
You'll want to make sure that your emails

53
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:13,340
are clear and concise so
they don't get lost in the shuffle.

54
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,451
Let's take a quick look at two emails so
that you can see what I mean.

55
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,892
Here's the first email. There's so

56
00:03:20,892 --> 00:03:25,690
much written here that it's kind of hard
to see where the important information is.

57
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,940
And this first paragraph doesn't give me a
quick summary of the important takeaways.

58
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,571
It's pretty casual to the greeting is

59
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:36,650
just, "Hey," and there's no sign off.

60
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,140
Plus I can already spot some typos.

61
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,771
Now let's take a look at
the second email. Already,

62
00:03:43,771 --> 00:03:45,570
it's less overwhelming, right?

63
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,230
Just a few sentences,
telling me what I need to know.

64
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,240
It's clearly organized and
there's a polite greeting and sign off.

65
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:01,040
This is a good example of an email; short
and to the point, polite and well-written.

66
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,140
All of the things we've
been talking about so far.

67
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,610
But what do you do if, what you need
to say is too long for an email?

68
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,340
Well, you might want to
set up a meeting instead.

69
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,880
It's important to answer
in a timely manner as well.

70
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,129
You don't want to take so

71
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:21,440
long replying to emails that your coworkers
start wondering if you're okay.

72
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,010
I always try to answer
emails in 24-48 hours.

73
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,136
Even if it's just to
give them a timeline for

74
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:30,340
when I'll have the actual
answers they're looking for.

75
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,130
That way,

76
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,840
I can set expectations and
they know I'm working on it.

77
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,880
That works the other way around too.

78
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,916
If you need a response on something
specific from one of your team members,

79
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:45,640
be clear about what you need and when you
need it so that they can get back to you.

80
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,075
I'll even include a date
in my subject line and

81
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:49,900
bold dates in the body of my email,

82
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,806
so it's really clear. Remember, being
clear about your needs is a big part

83
00:04:54,806 --> 00:04:57,740
of being a good communicator.

84
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,839
We covered some great ways to improve our
professional communication skills, like

85
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:08,740
asking questions, practicing good writing
habits and some email tips and tricks.

86
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,212
These will help you
communicate clearly and

87
00:05:11,212 --> 00:05:14,540
effectively with your team
members on any project.

88
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,364
It might take some time, but you'll find a
communication style that works for you and

89
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:21,590
your team, both in person and online.

90
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,255
As long as you're willing to learn,
you won't have any problems adapting to

91
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:30,651
the different communication
expectations you'll see in future jobs.
