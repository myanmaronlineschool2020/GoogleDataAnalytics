1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,215
We live in a world that
loves instant gratification,

2
00:00:04,215 --> 00:00:07,500
whether it's overnight
delivery or on-demand movies.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,590
We want what we want
and we want it now.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,120
But in the data world,

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,135
speed can sometimes be
the enemy of accuracy,

6
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:17,940
especially when
collaboration is required.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,310
We're going to talk
about how to balance

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,190
speedy answers with
right ones and how

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,170
to best address these issues by

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,305
re-framing questions
and outlining problems.

11
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:30,890
That way your team members and

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,110
stakeholders understand
what answers

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,330
they can expect when.

14
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,180
As data analysts,
we need to know the

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,150
why behind things
like a sales slump,

16
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,825
a player's batting average,
or rainfall totals.

17
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:46,835
It's not just about the figures,

18
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:49,630
it's about the context
too and getting

19
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,730
to the bottom of these
things takes time.

20
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,865
So if a stakeholder comes
knocking on your door,

21
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:57,035
a lot of times

22
00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:59,510
that person may not really
know what they need.

23
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,080
They just know they
want it at light speed.

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,410
But sometimes the
pressure gets to us and

25
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,550
even the most experienced
data analysts can be

26
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,500
tempted to cut
corners and provide

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,225
flawed or unfinished data
in the interest of time.

28
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:15,350
When that happens, so

29
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,960
much of the story in
the data gets lost.

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,060
That's why
communication is one of

31
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,975
the most valuable tools
for working with teams.

32
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:24,650
It's important to start with

33
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,220
structured thinking and a
well-planned scope of work,

34
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,430
which we talked about earlier.

35
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,899
If you start with a
clear understanding

36
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:34,910
of your stakeholders'
expectations,

37
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,490
you can then develop
a realistic scope of

38
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,755
work that outlines agreed
upon expectations,

39
00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:47,610
timelines, milestones,
and reports.

40
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,400
This way, your team always

41
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,920
has a road map to
guide their actions.

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,560
If you're pressured for something

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,045
that's outside of the scope,

44
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:57,440
you can feel confidence

45
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,780
setting more realistic
expectations.

46
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,130
At the end of the day,

47
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,750
it's your job to balance

48
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,895
fast answers with
the right answers.

49
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:07,820
Not to mention figuring out what

50
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,040
the person is really asking.

51
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,874
Now seems like a good
time for an example.

52
00:02:12,874 --> 00:02:16,700
Imagine your VP of HR shows
up at your desk demanding to

53
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,770
see how many new hires are

54
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,310
completing a training
course they've introduced.

55
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,360
She says, "There's no way

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,730
people are going through
each section of the course.

57
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,340
The human resources team
is getting slammed with

58
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,810
questions. We should probably
just cancel the program."

59
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,705
How would you respond?

60
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:36,095
Well, you could log
into the system,

61
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:38,930
crunch some numbers, and hand
them to your supervisor.

62
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,420
That would take no time at all.

63
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,215
But the quick answer might
not be the most accurate one.

64
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:48,215
So instead, you could
re-frame her question,

65
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:50,330
outline the problem, challenges,

66
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,150
potential solutions,
and time-frame.

67
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,770
You might say, "I can certainly

68
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,464
check out the rates
of completion,

69
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:58,925
but I sense there may be
more to the story here.

70
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:00,740
Could you give me two days to run

71
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,310
some reports and learn
what's really going on?"

72
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,050
With more time, you
can gain context.

73
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,820
You and the VP of HR

74
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,875
decide to expand the
project timeline,

75
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,600
so you can spend time gathering

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,340
anonymous survey data from

77
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,740
new employees about
the training course.

78
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,800
Their answers provide data
that can help you pinpoint

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,935
exactly why completion
rates are so low.

80
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,660
Employees are reporting that

81
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,885
the course feels
confusing and outdated.

82
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:27,740
Because you were able to take

83
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,780
time to address the
bigger problem,

84
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,250
the VP of HR has

85
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,710
a better idea about why
new employees aren't

86
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,660
completing the course and can

87
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,165
make new decisions
about how to update it.

88
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:40,880
Now the training course is
easy to follow and

89
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,985
the HR department isn't
getting as many questions.

90
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:46,330
Everybody benefits.

91
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,520
Redirecting the conversation
will help you find

92
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,560
the real problem which leads to

93
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,290
more insightful and
accurate solutions.

94
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,285
But it's important
to keep in mind,

95
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:58,310
sometimes you need
to be the bearer of

96
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,725
bad news and that's okay.

97
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:04,130
Communicating about problems,
potential solutions and

98
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,260
different expectations
can help you move

99
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,200
forward on a project
instead of getting stuck.

100
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,000
When it comes to communicating

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,190
answers with your teams
and stakeholders,

102
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,080
the fastest answer and the

103
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,575
most accurate answer aren't
usually the same answer.

104
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:20,900
But by making sure
that you understand

105
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,600
their needs and setting
expectations clearly,

106
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,670
you can balance
speed and accuracy.

107
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,395
Just make sure to be clear and

108
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:30,570
upfront and you'll find success.
