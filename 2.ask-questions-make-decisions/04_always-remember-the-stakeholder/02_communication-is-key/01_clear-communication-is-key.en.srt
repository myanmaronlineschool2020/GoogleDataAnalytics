1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,510
Welcome back. We've talked a lot

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,880
about understanding
your stakeholders and

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,850
your team so that you can
balance their needs and

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,300
maintain a clear focus on
your project objectives.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,430
A big part of that is building

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,430
good relationships with the
people you're working with.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,260
How do you do that? Two
words: clear communication.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,600
Now we're going to learn
about the importance of

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,920
clear communication with

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,350
your stakeholders
and team members.

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,660
Start thinking about
who you want to

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,180
communicate with and when.

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,120
First, it might
help to think about

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,010
communication
challenges you might

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,320
already experience
in your daily life.

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,600
Have you ever been in
the middle of telling

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,670
a really funny joke only to

18
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,460
find out your friend already
knows the punchline?

19
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,715
Or maybe they just didn't
get what was funny about it?

20
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,380
This happens all the time,

21
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,780
especially if you don't
know your audience.

22
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,140
This kind of thing can
happen at the workplace too.

23
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,110
Here's the secret to
effective communication.

24
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,065
Before you put together
a presentation,

25
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:05,030
send an e-mail, or even

26
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,520
tell that hilarious
joke to your co-worker,

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,160
think about who your audience is,

28
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,810
what they already know,

29
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,210
what they need to
know and how you

30
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,910
can communicate that
effectively to them.

31
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,625
When you start by thinking
about your audience,

32
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,280
they'll know it and
appreciate the time you

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,965
took to consider them
and their needs.

34
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:27,380
Let's say you're working
on a big project,

35
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,080
analyzing annual
sales data, and you

36
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,040
discover that all of the
online sales data is missing.

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,350
This could affect
your whole team and

38
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,750
significantly delay the project.

39
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,254
By thinking through
these four questions,

40
00:01:41,254 --> 00:01:43,280
you can map out the best way to

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,300
communicate across your
team about this problem.

42
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,365
First, you'll need to think
about who your audience is.

43
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:51,470
In this case, you'll
want to connect with

44
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,870
other data analysts
working on the project,

45
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,805
as well as your project manager

46
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:57,800
and eventually the VP of sales,

47
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,755
who is your stakeholder.

48
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:01,610
Next up, you'll think through

49
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,395
what this group already knows.

50
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:06,155
The other data analysts
working on this project know

51
00:02:06,155 --> 00:02:07,340
all the details about

52
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,905
which data-set you
are using already,

53
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:11,780
and your project manager knows

54
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,065
the timeline you're
working towards.

55
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:16,335
Finally, the VP of sales

56
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:19,145
knows the high-level
goals of the project.

57
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:21,260
Then you'll ask yourself what

58
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,600
they need to know
to move forward.

59
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,670
Your fellow data analysts need

60
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,620
to know the details of
where you have tried

61
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,890
so far and any potential
solutions you've come up with.

62
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,350
Your project manager would

63
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,970
need to know the different teams

64
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,290
that could be affected and

65
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,345
the implications for the project,

66
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:41,830
especially if this problem
changes the timeline.

67
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,980
Finally, the VP of sales will
need to know that there is

68
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,665
a potential issue that would
delay or affect the project.

69
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:52,010
Now that you've decided
who needs to know what,

70
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,175
you can choose the best way
to communicate with them.

71
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,620
Instead of a long,
worried e-mail which

72
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,185
could lead to lots
back and forth,

73
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:02,750
you decide to quickly
book in a meeting

74
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,510
with your project manager
and fellow analysts.

75
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,880
In the meeting, you let
the team know about

76
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,650
the missing online sales data

77
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,705
and give them more
background info.

78
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:13,700
Together, you discuss how

79
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,295
this impacts other
parts of the project.

80
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:18,515
As a team, you come
up with a plan

81
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:21,230
and update the project
timeline if needed.

82
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,180
In this case, the VP of

83
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,730
sales didn't need to be
invited to your meeting,

84
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,590
but would appreciate
an e-mail update

85
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,640
if there were changes to

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,040
the timeline which
your project manager

87
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,780
might send along herself.

88
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,610
When you communicate thoughtfully

89
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,590
and think about your
audience first,

90
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,420
you'll build better
relationships and

91
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,075
trust with your team
members and stakeholders.

92
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:44,090
That's important because
those relationships are key

93
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,620
to the project's success
and your own too.

94
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,450
When you're getting
ready to send an e-mail,

95
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,645
organize some meeting, or
put together a presentation,

96
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:56,405
think about who your audience is,

97
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:57,995
what they already know,

98
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:00,470
what they need to
know and how you

99
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,295
can communicate that
effectively to them.

100
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:05,390
Next up, we'll talk more

101
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,580
about communicating
at work and you'll

102
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,440
learn some useful
tips to make sure

103
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,020
you get your message
across clearly.
