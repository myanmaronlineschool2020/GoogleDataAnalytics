1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,910
Data has the power to change the world.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,693
Think about this.
A bank identifies 15 new opportunities to

3
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:14,430
promote a product,
resulting in $120 million in revenue.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,184
A distribution company figures out
a better way to manage shipping, reducing

5
00:00:19,184 --> 00:00:21,370
their cost by $500,000.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,268
Google creates a new tool that can
identify breast cancer tumors in nearby

7
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:27,840
lymph nodes.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,610
These are all amazing achievements, but
do you know what they have in common?

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,940
They're all the results of data analytics.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,170
You absolutely have the power to
change the world as a data analyst.

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,800
And it starts with how you
share data with your team.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,518
In this video,

13
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:47,870
we will think through all of the variables
you should consider when sharing data.

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,613
When you successfully
deliver data to your team,

15
00:00:50,613 --> 00:00:54,910
you can ensure that they're able to
make the best possible decisions.

16
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,560
Earlier we learned that speed can
sometimes affect accuracy when sharing

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,816
database information with a team.

18
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:05,923
That's why you need a solid process
that weighs the outcomes and

19
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:08,470
actions of your analysis.

20
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,670
So where do you start?

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,530
Well, the best solutions
start with questions.

22
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,712
You might remember from our last video,
that stakeholders will have a lot

23
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:22,340
of questions but it's up to you to
figure out what they really need.

24
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,310
So ask yourself, does your analysis
answer the original question?

25
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,660
Are there other angles
you haven't considered?

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,400
Can you answer any questions that may
get asked about your data and analysis?

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,400
That last question brings up
something else to think about.

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,770
How detailed should you be
when sharing your results?

29
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,650
Would a high level analysis be okay?

30
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,860
Above all else, your data analysis
should help your team make better,

31
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,090
more informed decisions.

32
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,509
Here is another example: Imagine
a landscaping company is facing rising

33
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:00,980
costs and they can't stay
competitive in the bidding process.

34
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,885
One question you could ask
to solve this problem is,

35
00:02:03,885 --> 00:02:08,570
can the company find new suppliers
without compromising quality?

36
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,449
If you gave them a high-level analysis,

37
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,789
you'd probably just include the number
of clients and cost of supplies.

38
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,030
Here your stakeholder might object.

39
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,263
She's worried that reducing quality
will limit the company's ability to stay

40
00:02:21,263 --> 00:02:24,040
competitive and keep customers happy.

41
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,940
Well, she's got a point.

42
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,970
In that case, you need to provide a more
detailed data analysis to change her mind.

43
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,579
This might mean exploring how
customers feel about different brands.

44
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:37,581
You might learn that customers
don't have a preference for

45
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:39,450
specific landscape brands.

46
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,628
So the company can change to the more
affordable suppliers without compromising

47
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:44,200
quality.

48
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,397
If you feel comfortable using the data
to answer all these questions and

49
00:02:49,397 --> 00:02:53,627
considerations, you've probably
landed on a solid conclusion. Nice!

50
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:57,936
Now that you understand some of the
variables involved with sharing data with

51
00:02:57,936 --> 00:03:02,574
a team, like process and outcome, you're
one step closer to making sure that your

52
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:07,170
team has all the information they need
to make informed, data-driven decisions.
