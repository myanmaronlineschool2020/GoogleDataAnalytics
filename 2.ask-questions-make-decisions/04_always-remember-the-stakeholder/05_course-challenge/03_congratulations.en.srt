1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,630
Now that you're done,
you're officially

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,670
ready to take on the next course.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,260
Awesome job.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,870
But before I tell you
about what's ahead,

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,720
let's take a moment to think
about what we've covered so

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,635
far in the first step of
the data analysis process.

7
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:20,265
In this course, we explored
effective questions

8
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:21,600
and we learned how to use

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,240
quantitative and
qualitative data,

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,510
metrics and math to
connect the dots.

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,910
We also covered
spreadsheet basics,

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,010
how to apply structured thinking

13
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,930
and key communication skills for

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,460
working with stakeholders and
team members. That's a lot!

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,670
Now it's time to take what

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,800
you learned into the next course,

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,990
where you'll tackle
the next step of

18
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,895
the data analysis process,
prepare your data.

19
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:51,420
Hallie is going to
take over from here.

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,730
You might remember her from

21
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,230
the beginning of
the first course!

22
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,350
She'll guide you as you
learn new important tools

23
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,895
for your work, like data
types and data structures;

24
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:03,810
bias and credibility
in analytics;

25
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,455
databases;

26
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:08,225
organizing and
protecting your data;

27
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:10,309
and the data community.

28
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:12,590
Thanks for sticking with
me through this course.

29
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,150
When you're ready, you can go

30
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,535
ahead to the first video
in the next course.

31
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,980
Good luck. You're
going to do great.
