2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,430
Joining a new team was definitely
scary at the beginning.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,486
Especially at a company like
Google where it's really big and

4
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:12,023
everyone is extremely smart.

5
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:16,423
But I really leaned on my manager
to understand what I could bring to

6
00:00:16,423 --> 00:00:17,217
the table.

7
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:21,686
And that made me feel a lot more
comfortable in meetings while sharing my

8
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:22,513
abilities.

9
00:00:22,513 --> 00:00:26,982
I found that my best projects start off
when the communication is really clear

10
00:00:26,982 --> 00:00:28,503
about what's expected.

11
00:00:28,503 --> 00:00:31,491
If I leave the meeting
where the project has been

12
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:35,464
asked of me knowing exactly where
to start and what I need to do,

13
00:00:35,464 --> 00:00:39,191
that allows for me to get it done faster,
more efficiently, and

14
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:40,997
getting to the real goal of it

15
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:45,513
and maybe going an extra step further
because I didn't have to spend any time

16
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,784
confused on what I needed to be doing.

17
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:52,307
Communication is so important because
it gets you to the finish line the most

18
00:00:52,307 --> 00:00:55,284
efficiently and
also makes you look really good.

19
00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:58,399
When I first started I had a good
amount of projects thrown at me and

20
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,484
I was really excited.

21
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:03,555
So, I went into them without
asking too many questions.

22
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:07,746
At first that was an obstacle,
because while you can thrive in ambiguity,

23
00:01:07,746 --> 00:01:11,582
ambiguity as to what the project
objective is, can be really harmful

24
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:14,111
when you're actually trying
to get the goal done.

25
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:18,071
And I overcame that by simply taking
a step back when someone asks me to do

26
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:20,981
the project and
just clarifying what that goal was.

27
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,615
Once that goal was crisp,

28
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:25,859
I was happy to go into
the ambiguity of how to get there,

29
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,371
but the goal has to be really objective and clear.
