<h3>
 Question 2
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  You’re working on a data analysis project with a coworker, and the two of you disagree on what the data is telling you. Things get tense. The best course of action is to go to your supervisor and politely explain that your coworker is looking at the data incorrectly. Then, ask to work with a different coworker on future projects.

<h3>
 Question 3
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  A director emails you asking for a report by the end of the week. This type of report takes at least 10 days to complete correctly. What is the best course of action?
 </p>
</co-content>
<form>
 <label>
  <input name="2" type="radio"/>
  <co-content>
   <span>
    Forward the email to another data analyst on your team, and ask them to do the report instead. It’ll still be late, but at least it won’t reflect poorly on you.
   </span>
  </co-content>
  <br/>
 </label>
 <label>
  <input name="2" type="radio"/>
  <co-content>
   <span>
    Call the director, and let them know there’s no way anyone could possibly meet that deadline.
   </span>
  </co-content>
  <br/>
 </label>
 <label>
  <input name="2" type="radio"/>
  <co-content>
   <span>
    Email the director and say that you would be happy to do that, but you believe it will take 10 days to get the information you need. Then, ask if you can discuss the possibility of a different timeline.
   </span>
  </co-content>
  <br/>
 </label>
 <label>
  <input name="2" type="radio"/>
  <co-content>
   <span>
    Complete the report as best you can by the end of the week so you meet the requested deadline.
