Hey, I'm Nathan.

2
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:11,043
I'm a principal data analyst in the Trust
and Safety Organization at Google.

3
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:16,112
I joined the Marine Corps Reserves
when I was attending college,

4
00:00:16,112 --> 00:00:20,546
and the reserve unit I joined
was a field artillery unit.

5
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:23,817
So after a challenging
Marine Corps boot camp,

6
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:28,004
I went to field artillery fire direction
control school.

7
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:32,414
And for those of you that might
not know, fire direction

8
00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:36,824
control is considered the brains
of field artillery, and

9
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:41,695
we use all sorts of computers to
do our artillery calculations.

10
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:44,260
But just in case the computers went down,

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,647
we also were trained how to
use slide rules as a backup.

12
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:52,793
And then, a year later,
I had the opportunity to be activated as

13
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:58,132
a truck driver instead of my primary
job as a field artillery man and

14
00:00:58,132 --> 00:01:03,112
was deployed to Iraq to drive trucks for
an infantry company.

15
00:01:03,112 --> 00:01:09,669
After I got back from Iraq,
I finished up my bachelor's degree and

16
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:15,408
then worked as an applications
engineer in Austin, Texas,

17
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:22,104
and eventually saw the need to pivot
more to focus more on business.

18
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:25,902
And that's when I really fell in
love with data analysis was when I

19
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:28,261
was learning a lot more about business.

20
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:32,712
It actually took me a couple of years,
when I really sparked an interest in

21
00:01:32,712 --> 00:01:36,066
data analysis to land a role where
I got to do it full time and

22
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:38,411
really get my hands dirty with the data.

23
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:43,003
Some of the things I did to lay
the groundwork to be ready and

24
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:48,719
be qualified for that was I took a
Coursera course on R and I also did some

25
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:55,027
data science hackathons where you spend
an entire weekend at some university.

26
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:58,881
And they release the dataset Friday
night and by Sunday afternoon,

27
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:01,544
you have to come up with
some recommendations.

28
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:06,135
So those were two really good
ways to really prepare myself,

29
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:11,238
get good experience and really show
a strong interest in data analysis.

30
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:16,105
My first job,
where I got to do data analysis full-time

31
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:20,225
was at a large bank and
I was just in heaven.

32
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:23,509
I got to really do SQL for real, and

33
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:28,959
also I got to use Tableau a ton.
Got to go to a Tableau conference.

34
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,086
It was really cool.

35
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:34,647
Then I was fortunate enough to
get an opportunity to move to

36
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:36,984
Google into my current role.

37
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:38,775
That's in trust and safety.

38
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:41,266
And what's super exciting and

39
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:45,768
fulfilling about that is that
similar to the military,

40
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:52,302
it has an overall mission of protecting
people, so that's super exciting for me.

41
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,462
The things that were instilled in me in

42
00:02:54,462 --> 00:02:58,263
the Marines that I use to this very
day would be attention to detail.

43
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:01,414
That's super important in
the military overall, but

44
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:06,220
especially in field artillery. Secondly,
is the importance of communication.

45
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,080
You have your own details locked in.

46
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,384
You need to make sure that those
are communicated really clearly to

47
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:16,282
other people that you're working with and
the third would be collaboration.

48
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:18,729
In the military teamwork
makes the dream work.

49
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,270
You really rely on the team.

50
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,461
That's definitely been the case in my
post Marine Corps career and jobs.
