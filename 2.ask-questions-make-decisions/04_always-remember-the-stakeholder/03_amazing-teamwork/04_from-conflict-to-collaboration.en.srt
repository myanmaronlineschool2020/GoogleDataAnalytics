1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,125
It's normal for conflict to
come up in your work life.

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,240
A lot of what you've
learned so far,

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,790
like managing expectations
and communicating

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,474
effectively can help
you avoid conflict,

5
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:14,490
but sometimes you'll run
into conflict anyways.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,470
If that happens,
there are ways to

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,405
resolve it and move forward.

8
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:21,210
In this video, we will talk
about how conflict could

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,145
happen and the best ways

10
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:25,800
you can practice
conflict resolution.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,070
A conflict can pop up
for a variety of reasons.

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,870
Maybe a stakeholder misunderstood

13
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,090
the possible outcomes
for your project;

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,920
maybe you and your
team member have

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,810
very different work styles;

16
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,640
or maybe an important deadline is

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,845
approaching and
people are on edge.

18
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:44,270
Mismatched expectations
and miscommunications

19
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,705
are some of the most common
reasons conflicts happen.

20
00:00:47,705 --> 00:00:50,120
Maybe you weren't clear
on who was supposed to

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,610
clean a dataset and
nobody cleaned it,

22
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,010
delaying a project. Or maybe

23
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,570
a teammate sent out an email

24
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,445
with all of your
insights included,

25
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:00,805
but didn't mention
it was your work.

26
00:01:00,805 --> 00:01:04,115
While it can be easy to
take conflict personally,

27
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:06,365
it's important to
try and be objective

28
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:09,175
and stay focused on
the team's goals.

29
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:11,360
Believe it or not,
tense moments

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,890
can actually be opportunities to

31
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,580
re-evaluate a project and
maybe even improve things.

32
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,335
So when a problem comes up,

33
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:20,420
there are a few ways you
can flip the situation

34
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,790
to be more productive
and collaborative.

35
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,710
One of the best
ways you can shift

36
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,055
a situation from
problematic to productive

37
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,830
is to just re-frame
the problem. Instead of

38
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,295
focusing on what went
wrong or who to blame,

39
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,670
change the question
you're starting with.

40
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,865
Try asking, how can I
help you reach your goal?

41
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:42,890
This creates an opportunity

42
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,660
for you and your
team members to work

43
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,940
together to find a
solution instead

44
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,525
of feeling frustrated
by the problem.

45
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:53,195
Discussion is key to
conflict resolution.

46
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:54,920
If you find yourself
in the middle of

47
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,035
a conflict, try to communicate,

48
00:01:57,035 --> 00:02:00,035
start a conversation
or ask things like,

49
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:03,205
are there other important
things I should be considering?

50
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:05,570
This gives your team members or

51
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,870
stakeholders a chance to
fully lay out your concerns.

52
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,360
But if you find yourself
feeling emotional,

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,910
give yourself some time
to cool off so you can

54
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,735
go into the conversation
with a clearer head.

55
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:19,685
If I need to write an email
during a tense moment,

56
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:21,290
I'll actually save it to drafts

57
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,850
and come back to
it the next day to

58
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,425
reread it before sending

59
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:26,980
to make sure that I'm
being level-headed.

60
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,030
If you find you don't
understand what

61
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,210
your team member or stakeholder
is asking you to do,

62
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,165
try to understand the
context of their request.

63
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:37,340
Ask them what their end goal is,

64
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,030
what story they're
trying to tell with

65
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,180
the data or what
the big picture is.

66
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,230
By turning moments of
potential conflict into

67
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,125
opportunities to collaborate
and move forward,

68
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,640
you can resolve tension

69
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,790
and get your project
back on track.

70
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,050
Instead of saying, "There's
no way I can do that in this

71
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,840
time frame," try to
re-frame it by saying,

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,510
"I would be happy to do that,

73
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,370
but I'll just take
this amount of time,

74
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,020
let's take a step back so I can

75
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,670
better understand
what you'd like to do

76
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,650
with the data and we
can work together

77
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,370
to find the best path forward."

78
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,725
With that, we've reached
the end of this section.

79
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,105
Great job.

80
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:15,380
Learning how to work with

81
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,960
new team members can be a
big challenge in starting

82
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,990
a new role or a new project but

83
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,115
with the skills you've
picked up in these videos,

84
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:23,600
you'll be able to start on

85
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,170
the right foot with
any new team you join.

86
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,000
So far, you've learned
about balancing the needs

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,045
and expectations of your team
members and stakeholders.

88
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,340
You've also covered
how to make sense of

89
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,280
your team's roles and focus
on the project objective,

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,690
the importance of

91
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,480
clear communication
and communication

92
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,640
expectations in a workplace,

93
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,260
and how to balance

94
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,085
the limitations of data
with stakeholder asks.

95
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:50,360
Finally, we covered how to have

96
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,250
effective team meetings and

97
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,170
how to resolve
conflicts by thinking

98
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,725
collaboratively with
your team members.

99
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:59,720
Hopefully now you
understand how important

100
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,825
communication is to the
success of a data analyst.

101
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,570
These communication skills
might feel a little

102
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,650
different from some of

103
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,339
the other skills you've been
learning in this program,

104
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:11,690
but they're also an
important part of

105
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,580
your data analyst toolkit and

106
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,940
your success as a
professional data analyst.

107
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,590
Just like all of

108
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,110
the other skills you're
learning right now,

109
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,360
your communication
skills will grow

110
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,610
with practice and experience.
