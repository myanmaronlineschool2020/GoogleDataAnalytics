1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,525
Now it's time to
discuss meetings.

2
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:05,280
Meetings are a huge
part of how you

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,400
communicate with team
members and stakeholders.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,480
Let's cover some easy-to-follow
do's and don'ts,

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,345
you can use for meetings
both in person or online

6
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:16,500
so that you can use

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,950
these communication best
practices in the future.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,280
At their core, meetings make
it possible for you and

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,590
your team members
or stakeholders to

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,095
discuss how a project is going.

11
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,460
But they can be so
much more than that.

12
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,750
Whether they're
virtual or in person,

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,155
team meetings can build
trust and team spirit.

14
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:38,240
They give you a chance
to connect with

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,165
the people you're working
with beyond emails.

16
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:43,250
Another benefit is that

17
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,260
knowing who you're
working with can give you

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,790
a better perspective of where

19
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,505
your work fits into
the larger project.

20
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:51,980
Regular meetings also make

21
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,185
it easier to
coordinate team goals,

22
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:57,355
which makes it easier to
reach your objectives.

23
00:00:57,355 --> 00:00:59,600
With everyone on the same page,

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,910
your team will be in the
best position to help

25
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,065
each other when you
run into problems too.

26
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,315
Whether you're leading a
meeting or just attending it,

27
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:09,950
there are best practices you can

28
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,530
follow to make sure your
meetings are a success.

29
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,570
There are some
really simple things

30
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,855
you can do to make
a great meeting.

31
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:19,230
Come prepared, be on time,

32
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,440
pay attention, and ask questions.

33
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,355
This applies to both meetings

34
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:26,490
you lead and ones you attend.

35
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,280
Let's break down
how you can follow

36
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,790
these to-dos for every meeting.

37
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,525
What do I mean when
I say come prepared?

38
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:35,145
Well, a few things.

39
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:37,275
First, bring what you need.

40
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:38,625
If you like to take notes,

41
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,310
have your notebook and pens in

42
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,725
your bag or your
work device on hand.

43
00:01:42,725 --> 00:01:44,585
Being prepared also means

44
00:01:44,585 --> 00:01:46,460
you should read the
meeting agenda ahead of

45
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,350
time and be ready to provide
any updates on your work.

46
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,905
If you're leading the meeting,

47
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:54,530
make sure to prepare your
notes and presentations

48
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,680
and know what you're going
to talk about and of course,

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,705
be ready to answer questions.

50
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:01,640
These are some other tips that I

51
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,940
like to follow when
I'm leading a meeting.

52
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,770
First, every meeting
should focus on making

53
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,690
a clear decision and include

54
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,364
the person needed to
make that decision.

55
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,015
And if there needs to be a
meeting in order to make

56
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:16,925
a decision, schedule
it immediately.

57
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:18,590
Don't let progress stall by

58
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,615
waiting until next
week's meeting.

59
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:22,820
Lastly, try to keep the number of

60
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,700
people at your meeting
under 10 if possible.

61
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,710
More people makes it hard to

62
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,230
have a collaborative discussion.

63
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,680
It's also important to respect
your team members' time.

64
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,420
The best way to do this is
to come to meetings on time.

65
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,900
If you're leading the meeting,

66
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,430
show up early and set up

67
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,490
beforehand so you're ready
to start when people arrive.

68
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,100
You can do the same thing
for online meetings.

69
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,070
Try to make sure your technology
is working beforehand

70
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,570
and that you're watching
the clock so you

71
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,295
don't miss a meeting
accidentally.

72
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:54,770
Staying focused and attentive
during a meeting is

73
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,000
another great way to respect
your team members' time.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,180
You don't want to miss

75
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,410
something important
because you were

76
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,245
distracted by something
else during a presentation.

77
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:05,150
Paying attention also means

78
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,775
asking questions when
you need clarification,

79
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:09,350
or if you think there may be

80
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,380
a problem with a project plan.

81
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,030
Don't be afraid to reach
out after a meeting.

82
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,070
If you didn't get to
ask your question,

83
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,355
follow up with the group
afterwards and get your answer.

84
00:03:19,355 --> 00:03:21,830
When you're the person
leading the meeting,

85
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,114
make sure you build and send
out an agenda beforehand,

86
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:27,110
so your team members
can come prepared

87
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,380
and leave with clear takeaways.

88
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,000
You'll also want to
keep everyone involved.

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,910
Try to engage with all
your attendees so you

90
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,140
don't miss out on any insights
from your team members.

91
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,100
Let everyone know
that you're open to

92
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,950
questions after the meeting too.

93
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,760
It's a great idea to take

94
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,730
notes even when you're
leading the meeting.

95
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,880
This makes it easier to

96
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,045
remember all questions
that were asked.

97
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:51,230
Then afterwards you can follow up

98
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,450
with individual team
members to answer

99
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,790
those questions or
send an update to

100
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,285
your whole team depending on
who needs that information.

101
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:02,420
Now let's go over what
not to do in meetings.

102
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,970
There are some
obvious "don'ts" here.

103
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,965
You don't want to
show up unprepared,

104
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:09,770
late, or distracted for meetings.

105
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,680
You also don't want to
dominate the conversation,

106
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,660
talk over others, or distract

107
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,850
people with unfocused discussion.

108
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,060
Try to make sure you give
other team members a chance to

109
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,160
talk and always let them finish

110
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,565
their thought before
you start speaking.

111
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,210
Everyone who is attending

112
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,505
your meeting should be
giving their input.

113
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:31,745
Provide opportunities
for people to speak up,

114
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:34,685
ask questions, call
for expertise,

115
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:36,745
and solicit their feedback.

116
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:38,610
You don't want to miss out on

117
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,480
their valuable insights.
And try to have everyone

118
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,730
put their phones or
computers on silent when

119
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,550
they're not speaking,
you included.

120
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,160
Now we've learned some
best practices you can

121
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,650
follow in meetings
like come prepared,

122
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,685
be on time, pay attention,
and ask questions.

123
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:57,740
We also talked about
using meetings

124
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,440
productively to make
clear decisions and

125
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,650
promoting collaborative
discussions and to reach out

126
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,970
after a meeting to address

127
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,975
questions you or
others might have had.

128
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,365
You also know what not to do in

129
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:13,025
meetings: showing up unprepared,

130
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:15,980
late, or distracted, or

131
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,980
talking over others and
missing out on their input.

132
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,795
With these tips in mind,

133
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:22,280
you'll be well on your way to

134
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,895
productive, positive
team meetings.

135
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:26,600
But of course, sometimes

136
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,160
there will be conflict
in your team.

137
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,010
We'll discuss conflict
resolution soon.
